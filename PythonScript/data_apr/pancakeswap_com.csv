For future generations:

&gt;Alice deposits 1 ETH and 100 DAI in a liquidity pool. In this particular automated market maker (AMM), the deposited token pair needs to be of equivalent value. This means that the price of ETH is 100 DAI at the time of deposit. This also means that the dollar value of Alice’s deposit is 200 USD at the time of deposit.  
&gt;  
&gt;In addition, there’s a total of 10 ETH and 1,000 DAI in the pool – funded by other LPs just like Alice. So, Alice has a 10% share of the pool, and the total liquidity is 10,000.  
&gt;  
&gt;Let’s say that the price of ETH increases to 400 DAI. While this is happening, [arbitrage](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/arbitrage) traders will add DAI to the pool and remove ETH from it until the ratio reflects the current price. Remember, AMMs don’t have order books. What determines the price of the assets in the pool is the **ratio between them in the pool**. While liquidity remains constant in the pool (10,000), the ratio of the assets in it changes.  
&gt;  
&gt;If ETH is now 400 DAI, the ratio between how much ETH and how much DAI is in the pool has changed. There is now 5 ETH and 2,000 DAI in the pool, thanks to the work of arbitrage traders.  
&gt;  
&gt;So, Alice decides to withdraw her funds. As we know from earlier, she’s entitled to a 10% share of the pool. As a result, she can withdraw 0.5 ETH and 200 DAI, totaling 400 USD. She made some nice profits since her deposit of tokens worth 200 USD, right? But wait, what would have happened if she simply holds her 1 ETH and 100 DAI? The combined dollar value of these holdings would be 500 USD now.  
&gt;  
&gt;We can see that Alice would have been better off by [HODLing](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/hodl) rather than depositing into the liquidity pool. This is what we call impermanent loss. In this case, Alice’s loss wasn’t that substantial as the initial deposit was a relatively small amount. Keep in mind, however, that impermanent loss can lead to big losses (including a significant portion of the initial deposit).  
&gt;  
&gt;With that said, Alice’s example completely disregards the trading fees she would have earned for providing liquidity. In many cases, the fees earned would negate the losses and make providing liquidity profitable nevertheless. Even so, it’s crucial to understand impermanent loss before providing liquidity to a DeFi protocol.

Token B: $100  
When you put them in a pool, the value has to be equal. So, you deposit:  
10x Token A   
1x Token B   
for a total of $200. 

Now, let's say Token B drops to $50. The pool ALWAYS has to have a 50/50 ratio in value between the 2 coins, but right now it has $100 of A and only $50 of B. So, arbitrage traders/bots sell $25 of A to buy $25 more of B. Now, you have:  
7.5x TokenA   
1.5x token B each worth $75, for a total of $150. If you cash out now, you lost $50 in value, and get back that current amount of each token/coin. Impermanent loss is a misleading name in many ways, as its only impermanent until you cash out, just like a stock/crypto being lower price.. when you do unstake, the losses become very much real.

I want to point out, that if this specific scenario happens, you still turn a profit. People think that if the prices change drastically, that means you 'lost' money. You will still be up overall, you'll just make LESS then if you had held the coins yourself and not put them in a LP. You lose a portion of your profits, but you don't have a net loss of money if the coins go up in value.

Not saying you specifically think this, but people see the loss in 'impermanent loss' and get it mixed up.",1614733318,t3_lvyrz7,t1_gpf8cer,3,pancakeswap,0
105,[],mrzinke,"The general rule of thumb is the higher the APR, the higher the risk. If you just do a stablecoin pair, there's effectively no impermanent loss (IL), but the rewards are far less.   


If you're doing a pair that includes that site's token (CAKE, in this case), you can lose a lot if one/both coins in the pair are down in value when you unstake. If it's a pair of coins you believe in long term (let's say.. BNB and DOT) and you would've held some of both anyway.. then you're mostly just making extra money.   


Same thing for staking a single coin in their pools. You are only exposed to whether that coin goes up/down, not two different ones. But, the interest rates are also generally lower then.   


In any case, those really high APRs in some pools aren't just free money like many seem to think. There is a considerable risk that your assets will lose more value then you gain in interest. Or, at least, offset the profits by a fair amount. The way the system works, there is a heavy inflationary effect on most of their tokens. It's something they are all trying to fight constantly, introducing various mechanisms to combat the increasing supply. In other words, it's unlikely that CAKE suddenly does a 10x in value.

I have tried also to simply send a transaction worth 0 to the contract (the ""sender"" in of the portion of the swap where the transaction failed.  But, again, nonce too low.  It doesn't even get to the chain.   The hash is not found in bscscan.  I additionally tried to send the same to the address of the wallet.  Both ""nonce too low.""  


Is there any kind of dev team that can be contacted?

Trading the charts doesn't seem to work when you begin researching a bit more and finding out a coin inflates. Keyword, inflate.  


I have never seen a ""coin"" in my life of CC (2015) go UNDER opening price. I bought at a pretty low price, assuming past performance of everything MAY indicate future performance.  


There are two thought processes for most minors here under 30 years old who are in moon boy territory, who probably just began earning their first stub in life assuming they're going to become moon lambo owners.  


Trade the technicals with the technicals OF the coin of ownership! technicals here of the coin are:  
1. Coin is inflated. Yield is just a gimmick way (marketing) to take your money by the smart money that made the coin to begin with. Buying back and burning (while value still tanks) and inflating at the same time, is like pulling the rug under your feet at a slow pace so you don't die.  


2. Price dropping below first day of opening on the exchange. (Personally never seen this before) and have it bounce back. lol  


No offense, but I will be selling as soon as it bounces back to $9.80. For those ""HODLING"" for ""future dreams and performance"", don't believe these moon boy minors who ignore facts. This is crypto currency, not fantasy land. You will be dumped to ICO low prices. And as BTC dumps to new local lows over a period, this pancake coin will be losing value at an insane rate as its supply goes ""to the moon"".

IL happens when token prices diverge from your purchase point. This means that if you extracted them, you would get less or more of one than the other. It's about the ratio between them. 

So, when you enter a pool, if token A skyrockets but token B stays at its price, your IL goes through the roof. This is why Volatile/Stablecoin pairs have high interest, to offset the inevitable IL that the volatility will create.

It's a PITA. I have a pool I am sort of stuck in until one of the tokens drops in value so my IL is reasonable.

950,[],r3compile,"When you provide liquidity, you grant a pair of tokens in a fixed ratio. As the price deviates from that ratio, the balance in the pool shifts, since people conducting swaps will be exchanging the assets in a different ratio than the one in which you provided your liquidity. This means when you remove liquidity, there's potentially just not enough of one asset vs. the other to give you back your original position.


Consider this overly simplistic scenario:


1 FOO and 1 BAR are both worth $100 USD each


You provide 10 FOO and 10 BAR tokens, a position of $2000 USD. The pool has 1000 FOO and 1000 BAR. You are providing 1% of the liquidity. The constant product of the pool is total FOO * total BAR = 1000 * 1000 = 1,000,000


Suppose the price of FOO has risen by 10% to $110, and the price of BAR has fallen 10% to $90. So 1 FOO = 1.222 BAR.


FOO liquidity = sqrt(constant_product / FOO price in BAR) = sqrt(1,000,000 / 1.222) = 904.61

BAR liquidity = sqrt(constant_product * FOO price in BAR) = sqrt(1,000,000 * 1.222) = 1105.44


Your 1% share of the pool is now worth 9.0461 FOO and 11.0544 BAR. That's $995 + $995 = $1990. If, rather than providing liquidity, you had just held your 10 FOO and 10 BAR, you'd have $1100 + $900 = $2000. Thus you incurred a loss of $10, or 0.5% of your original position.

However, you earn fees when swaps of your pair occur. Swapping fees are 0.2%. In the example above, suppose the daily trade volume on the pool is $50,000. 0.2% of $50,000 = $100. As someone with a 1% position in the pool, you earn $1/day in fees, meaning it would take 10 days to recoup your $10 in losses.

So, you can see that the longer you provide liquidity, the more price volatility you can withstand without incurring a loss. Also, if the prices revert back to their original ratio before you withdraw your liquidity, all of your impermanent losses go away and you are left with $1/day in pure profit.

If the pool is rarely utilized for swaps, and the price of the pair also deviates substantially, then you would stand to lose money. Thus, the riskiest pools are those which have both low trade volume as well as high price volatility.",1615651342,t3_m48ot5,t3_m48ot5,1,pancakeswap,0

I agree with your point that continuing to stake it and earn more even during a market crash / price collapse is sensible. After all, accumulation is the goal.

However, as the poster above me notes, we aren’t guaranteed to see a return to - or bearing of - previous highs if this happens.

It’s also worth considering whether that APY can hold up. If the price collapses but people remain staked and there’s good liquidity, it could stay similar or even increase. However, if people panic during a bear market we could see a lot withdraw from the pools.

Miners depreciate with difficulty, see https://www.asicminervalue.com/miners/ on how most BTC hardware from 2017 and before is worthless unless you have access to free or close to free electricity (and 2018 is close to 0 profit now). Also if all coins for an algo lose value, then mining that algo doesn't produce value and thus a miner for that algo is basically worthless too. 

&gt; Hardware miners are tangible, staking pools aren't. I like tangibility.

Same reasoning as calling real estate investments better over stocks (""you can't live in a stock!""), or why stocks are better than options and futures (""owning a stock is owning an actual part of a company! options are just virtual promises!""). I don't really see the point except the appeal to emotion.

[BakerySwap announced their plans today](https://bakeryswap.medium.com/new-ido-on-march-11-crudeoil-finance-d5d7cb955812) for how they will approach this problem:

\- hard cap on the offering

\- limited participation per address and per transaction

\- requirement to hold a proportional amount of the platform token (BAKE) in the address sending the transaction

It'll be interesting to see how it plays out and hopefully the PancakeSwap team can get some helpful information from how it performs.

Anything that can give a better / fairer opportunity for people to participate \_while still meeting the hard cap\_ is a great step forwards. If the needs of the offering party (e.g. BELT) can be met while also allowing as many people as possible a fair chance to participate and get a share of it, that sounds like a great step forwards and definitely something worth aiming for.",1615367172,t3_m1smug,t3_m1smug,1,pancakeswap,0

I want to say something about this migrator code in case people didn't read the medium.

Firstly, the reason it exists was to migrate Uniswap's LP into Sushiswap's LP. If we trust the owner behind using this migrator code is a good person, it won't cause any problem unless someone with the deployer key got hacked but which is very unlikely.

Secondly, Pancake is a reputable exchange site that has backup from Binance. I am sure Pancake will not do a rugpull for sure.

But, many people got their funds stolen due to this migrator code as those creators used it in a malicious way. I am very confident that Pancake swap is safe, but please also stay away from sites that have migrator code as they are not as reputable as Pancake.

Even Binance has made a post to ask people to stay away from contracts that have this migrator code.

first off, what is the difference between staking and buying CAKE straight up on binance?  if i stake (aka farm?) i’m earning more CAKE as well?  

and under the hood of all this, how can staking generate returns? where is this return coming from?",1613465149,t3_lkxs8i,t3_lkxs8i,1,pancakeswap,0
1503,[],locosantoso,"You can withdraw from pools/farms whenever you'd like. 

CAKE definitely does have a purpose, it's not a valueless token. by earning CAKE LP tokens from providing liquidity, you can use them to buy IFO (new farms) tokens. These IFO's are up to you to research and do your DD to figure out for yourself if they're worth it or not. You can also use cake to buy NFT, and also to buy lottery tickets if gambling is kinda your thing.  


The bigger picture however is that right now while pancakeswap is the 3rd (sometimes 2nd, beating sushiswap) most used dex, it's still a relatively new project and they need liquidity. By paying you cake as your yield, they can keep up their liquidity while the dex operates. As pancakeswap grows bigger, they will also earn more fees (that they can use as liquidity themselves) and thus the yield of cake rewards you get from staking will go down. However, at this point in the future (when pancakeswap is big enough, should you believe it will get there) your CAKE will have more value, and you can go exchange it for a BEP20 of your choosing and cash out on it.   


That being said what u/-Smajser said is correct. CAKE is highly speculative depending on whether or not you think pancakeswap is a good project. If you ask me, it's one of the largest defi exchanges and the fact that BSC fees are hundreds of times lower than ethereum fees (which people would pay on sushiswap and uniswap), I definitely think good things may lie ahead for pancakeswap. If after your own DD you find out it's not for you, that's okay! always other moves you can do.

Liquidity staking, or yield farming, is all about maximizing return on your liquidity investment. The CAKE token, like the UNI token on Uniswap, exists as a reward to incentivize use of the platform. It works as a governance token, but it only has value if the market decides the platform itself has value. (So far, the market loves PancakeSwap, so yes, CAKE has value.)

Personally, I have no compelling reason to hold the CAKE token itself, so I swap it for BNB as soon as I harvest it, then take it to Binance to either cash it out or trade it for something else.

But what if there was breaking news that apples cure COVID-19 and the price skyrocketed to $100/apple? Now you’re out $1,000 for the same 10 apples. When trading crypto, the volatility in asset price can create such a situation where the executed price is different from the quoted and expected price. Slippage is the expected % difference between these quoted and executed prices.  
&gt;  
&gt;Low liquidity can also cause increased slippage, which is why larger orders tend to face higher slippage. This is generally a problem with market orders. When placing limit orders, your trade will only get executed at or above the limit price. But with market orders, you buy at the price at which the market is willing to sell.

If you havent already, first add the BSC network to your metamask wallet. Plenty of youtube videos on how to do this.

Then send your BNB from Kucoin through a bridge like, binance .org/bridge , or bearn .fi/bridge, and I think Rubic .exchange is working on one(maybe it works?), and maybe 1inch has a bridge?

EDIT: Actually, maybe someone can chime in, not sure if you can send straight from Kucoin to a bridge? 

I have not used all of these bridges so maybe do a little more research first or try sending a small amount the first time to make sure it all goes through correctly.

One more thing, if you're in the USA then you will have to use a vpn to use the binance bridge.

1658,[],Aztec-8,"*Some more info about the BEP-20 standard and the different tokens*

BEP-20 is a [token](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/token) standard on Binance Smart Chain. In [this article](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/bep-20), they explain that ""one could equally create a **native asset as a BEP-20 token**, or even **peg tokens from other blockchains to make them usable on Binance Smart Chain**. This is what’s done with “Peggy” coins, which are essentially BEP-20 versions of other crypto assets (such as LINK or XRP). Like BEP-2 tokens on Binance Chain, **BEP-20 token transfers are fuelled with** [**BNB**](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-bnb)**.**""

In other words, you'll need some BNB to pay for your transfers on the bsc, whether you transfer native BEP-20 token (BNB, XVS, CAKE) or some peggy coins. You can see the list of BEP-20 tokens [here](https://bscscan.com/tokens?p=1).",1614382335,t3_lspi2r,t1_gowq90q,1,pancakeswap,0
1659,[],Aztec-8,"&gt;After you have done that, you have to deposit $BNB into your wallet. Usually the biggest snag is here. BNB and BSC tokens are interchangeable, and of equal value. And both carry the same BNB ticker (for real Binance 🤦). [BSC Explainer](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/an-introduction-to-binance-smart-chain-bsc). You have to deposit the smart chain version of BNB into metamask. Caught me up the first time, not gonna lie. Swapping them can be done at Binance, UNLESS you're a GD American. For simplicity sakes, just send regular BNB to Trust Wallet first, and then convert to smart chain. You can then move it over to metamask if you still want to use metamask. (No wonder we always get these questions)

I'm not sure I understand what you mean here with the conversion to ""BSC tokens"". I'm not a US citizen and I think I don't need to swap them on Binance. BNB is the native token for the Binance ecosystem, it is used to secure the network and pay for fees (like ETH for the Ethereum network) so for me, there's just BNB. For example, you can directly send some BNB from Binance to Metamask (after you connected it to the BSC network).\*

TL;DR

\*As said [DecentBlock\_Ali](https://www.reddit.com/r/Metamask/comments/is4xna/how_do_you_add_bnb_to_metamask_on_bsc_have_eth_in/gnn3ghl?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), ""if you’re using binance.com, just withdraw your BNB to your metamask wallet as BEP20 (the second option). If you’re a US citizen, you’ll need to install the Binance Chain Wallet extension for your browser. Send your BNB there, swap your BNB BEP2 for BEP20 within the wallet, and transfer to metamask.""",1614382268,t3_lspi2r,t3_lspi2r,1,pancakeswap,0

Now, a few months down the line, the relative price of BNB and Cake changed a bit, now your LP token is worth about 0.9 BNB and 30 Cake, but you also add in all the fees accrued during that period (from the liquidity pool your provided and not the staking), so it comes to something like 1 BNB and 35 Cake.  

&amp;#x200B;

So that means that that's what you get at the end of you providing liquidity to the pool when you cash in your tokens.  Now sell your BNB and Cake at current market price, lets say BNB is up to 275 usd and Cake is down to 7 usd.  Your total is now worth 520 usd (from an investment of 500 usd).  But if both the BNB and Cake went down in price, then you'll lose the difference.  So lets say that BNB now =200 USD and Cake=8, then you'll have 480 usd at the end because they went down in price even though you technically have more of them.

&amp;#x200B;

This is all without taking into consideration the Cake you earn from staking which might help offset any losses or bolster your earnings.  If you don't want the risk of betting on their future price to go up or down, you can always just provdie liquidity to pools of equal value coins like BUSD-USDT, and that means that you're investment will only increase, but at a much lower rate than other pools.

I will start mentioning, be careful with the investments. If you don't need the money in the short term, go ahead and do it. Having said that, there are two options in pancakeswap to earn from the interests, one is from farms and the other is from pools. For farms you must stake two pair of tokens, and due to the changes in the price you could get affected by impermanent loss. Nonetheless, if there isn't big movements your earnings will offset any impermanent loss. 

About buying a shirt, IMO I would invest that money in PS, I believe a lot in the DEX that I know I could put that money into good use, and in a couple of months buy myself a couple of more shirts, hell I could even buy some underwear.

So the whales got it at a price of $0.10 for participating in the IFO, then upon trading going live the price was about 800x  the price that the whales got it at, and all the little fish like me were going and nibling away like piranhas as the whales pumped there massive gains.   I bought a handful at $7.xx,  then about 1 minute later the price was at $3.xx so I doubled down, then the price kept falling and now the price is at about 0.75.   So I paid about $300 for membership tokens that are now worth $80, and I dont even know if I ended up with enough to actually get the PRO services.

\*My strategy has been similar to yours.  Right now I have about $10k allocated towards simply STAKING cake.  And I have about $5k allocated to high APR LP (DEXE-BUSD).    


\*The $5k I've allocated to LP feels generates cake tokens about 2x as fast as my staked cake.   


\*I harvest twice daily from staked cake+yield farm and put it all towards compounding more staked cake.

Short term, the data points to YES.   


About $10k allocated towards staking cake.  (I've also allocated a smaller amount to LP, but let's ignore that for now).  It has stayed at about 130% APY for the couple weeks I've been doing this.  


Right now, I have about earn about 3 cake tokens per day from this and I compound twice per day.  If cake stays at around $10 for the rest of the year, in theory I'd generate 100% from simple interest alone.  But because I'm compounding daily, this number should go up significantly.  

I still consider this experimental.  Obvious risk is that cake tokens go down in value significantly, and I consider this the likeliest risk to occur.

B) Some of the underlying Tokens needed are really small cap, small projects. If they crash the pool will also crash imho. If you unstake your coins will be worthless. So choose the pools carefully. 

C) Double check the rates when swapping on Pancake. Some are really awful and you could get ~50% loss by swapping. Example: HGET

D) Yesterday I decided to move from Pool A to Pool B and ended up with about 20% loss. Not sure exactly which of the ~10 transactions needed caused it (probably all of them combined) but it hurts and it wilk take some weeks to recover this loss.

E*trade, Dlj Direct, Scottrade and so on..  As time evolved more easier user friendly platforms where created.  This will be the same situation for the crypto market.  It is common sense.  Right now pancake swap is that platform along with BSC that fill this roll and at the right time is critical.  In the future who knows what will be evolving and be a better system, but it is good to be diversified and doing research like this.  Once Apple figures out DAPPS this will add a whole new level of retail investors.  Currently DAPPS is not integrated on mobile wallets for Apple users..   I know this because my daughter can't do what I do on my android phone.  Once Apple pulls there head out of there ass we will have whole new flood of investors Farming and Staking..  I believe Apple is working on something as they always do to control the wealth pipeline into there favor... Nothing will ever be decentralized on there devices..  Anyone that currently has a Apple phone will literally miss out on the early stages .. I talked my daughter and alot of my friends to at least get a Droid tablet to be able to do the things you can do that you can't do on a Apple device.. Alot of money is left on the table yet..  This is sad but true.  If you are in this game of Staking and Farming currently and been doing it for a while..

He was using viking's APR for their VIKING pairs, for his math on the CAKE-BNB pair, which is much lower. Their CAKE-BNB pool was *maybe* 5% daily at the time he posted, currently 1.63%. So, he took that and assumed he'd make X from it over the next day on 5k worth, but that is ignoring fees and potential impermanent loss.   
I guarantee he doesn't understand impermanent loss, and his advice to compound every 3-4 hours is only sound if you have a pretty big investment. How often you harvest/compound will depend on how you're investing. You pay gas fees on each transaction, so the amount you're harvesting matters. If the amount you're compounding won't make an extra \~50 cents in profit before the next time you'd harvest, you shouldn't do it yet, you're just losing money from the fees.   
i.e. I wouldn't compound $5 worth, but rather wait till its a bit more to save a transaction fee. Unless that $5 is gonna generate an extra 50 cents in rewards between compounds, which is highly doubtful except on some pools VERY early on.",1614332116,t3_lrfzo0,t1_gorsq8d,1,pancakeswap,0

You're trying to stack CAKE in hopes that the prices of CAKE goes up so you can trade or exchange that CAKE for a profit. 

Think of the DEX like a Casino. CAKE are poker chips or in house tokens used to play ""Games"" in the casino, and in our case, the games being the Farms. By providing liquidity within the DEX you are basically investing in the Casino, because you believe that business model will be a success, and in turn, you earn interest on that liquidity as a reward. However, this Casino didn't have the capital as a start-up business to be able to fund the liquidity required to maintain the business model so they try to lure in investors like yourself to borrow money from, for a reward.

2. How are other people using our tokens

- they’re not. The tokens represent locked up BNB and CAKE that has been locked up for Pancake liquidity. People “use,” those tokens whenever they swap BNB for CAKE or vice versa.

I think on the BSC DeFi area, the spotlight is shining on staking, and the underlying LP is ignored when standalone.

However, if the LP is not in a vault, for the moment, one might have to make do with this:

3349,[],Plane-Sun238,"Hey there, sorry for my late reply.
IL stands for Impermanent Loss. It means if you provide liquidity with a coin pair in a liquidity pool and the price of these two coins changes significantly relative to each other, then you would suffer a loss if you were to remove the coin pair from the liquidity pool. Hence the name ""impermanent"". It is not permanent loss, unless you withdraw. The price levels may converge further down the road and your potential loss might be reduced or even negated.

Example: you buy BNB and CAKE - both for 100 USD (so you spend 200 USD altogether) and stake them in a liquidity pool on a decentralized exchange (DEX - like PanCakeSwap or SushiSwap) to earn a small portion of the swap fees between those two coins. During the following days CAKE price goes up 25% and BNB drops 25%. If you were to withdraw your liquidity then, you would suffer some percentage of impermanent loss - there is a calculator to find out the exact amount. you can google ""impermanent loss calculator"".
Now  you can decide to wait until the prices move a bit closer to each other and realize less loss.
The main idea of liquidity providing is speculating on higher returns on transaction fees than impermanent loss. FOr me that is a game for whales. The higher your share in a liquidity pool the bigger the cut you get from transaction fees. You are still taking exactly the same percentage of impermanent loss as a small investor. But as a small investor you barely can see any return on transaction fees. I think there is a sweetspot, a break-even point where it turns profitable to provide liquidity.
It may change with UniSwap v3 though. THere you can specify a certain proce range where you want to harvest transaction fees at (currently it is set to unlimited range). That way if the exchange rates are within your specified range, you can get even 40,000x transaction fees as long as the rate stays within your range - and you have a  decent share of the pool within that range.

3403,[],BigGingerJake,"On a separate note, do keep in mind that you are subject to *impermanent loss* when acting as a liquidity provider. In short, this means that as people swap the coins in the pool, the ratio of the coins changes, making it very unlikely to hold exactly the same ratio that you put into it upon your withdrawal.

Generally speaking, arbitrage traders will always be taking out whichever coins trade profitably against market-rates compared to the price in the pool. This means that as the market-price of one of the crypto coins changes, you should expect other traders to be buying it out of that pool, and ultimately reducing the number of the more profitable coins you will receive when you cash in your LP tokens - you will instead end up with more of the less profitable coins from the pair. This is what they give the ridiculous name *impermanent l*oss*.* Luckily, you will be making income from the fees paid for every swap in the pool.

To summarize, the more the two coins change in price compared to each other, the more *impermanent losses* you will suffer.

What you should take from this is that the more correlated the price of the pair of coins (the less comparatively volatile their prices), the less of an issue *impermanent los*s becomes.

The perfect scenario is a nice meaty APR (or APY if you use a compounding service like autofarm or beefy finance) for strongly correlated, relatively stable coins. This way you can sit back and enjoy LP rewards stacking up, while suffering close to zero *impermanent loss*.",1617155073,t3_mgs54w,t1_gsvacpk,1,pancakeswap,0
3404,[],BigGingerJake,"A WBNB-CAKE LP token is just a token which represents your portion of ownership of what is inside the liquidity pool. It is seldom a round number, and very unlikely to be 1-to-1 with your volumes of crypto in the pool.

When you cash in your LP tokens, you'll receive the same portion of the coins in the pool back to your wallet, plus some extra generated from the fees that people are charged when they use the liquidity pool to exchange their tokens. There's an awesome tool you can check your rewards on [here](https://www.yieldwatch.net/).

The fee for making a coin swap using a liquidity pool on pancakeswap is 0.2% of the transaction. Most of that (0.17%) is added into the pool as your reward for providing the liquidity.

Example: 

* There are 10 LP tokens representing 10 CAKE and 10 BNB tokens.
* 1 LP token = 1 CAKE + 1 BNB
* Someone trades 10 CAKE for 10 BNB
* Someone else trades 10 BNB for 10 CAKE
* The CAKE/BNB liquidity pool now has 10.017 CAKE and 10.017 BNB
* Each LP token is now worth 1.00017 CAKE + 1.00017 BNB",1617154839,t3_mgs54w,t3_mgs54w,1,pancakeswap,0

A token with no max cap is a bad one or a token with great inflation will kill the token. While yes, it could kill the token in the long run, however on the other hand take into consideration for how long pancakeswap is around. In the beginning of every token/coin there is a greater inflation in order to distribute it amongst the community. Nothing wrong here imo. Secondly there is a firm emission per block. Nothing percentual. This means, the longer the token is around, the lesser the inflation will be naturally no matter the burning or anything else. Lastly by lowering the inflation rate, you could kill the incentives for some farmers/stakers. They decide to pull out their stake and throw it onto the market. This will lower the price because of higher supply in the market itself even though the coin might be ""worth"" more since it has lower InFlAtIoN.

you need to use MetaMask on PCS. Import your account into MetaMask.

 

1. Open you Binance wallet
2. Below your balance, click on the three orizontal dots and then click ""export private key""
3. Copy the private key
4. Install the MetaMask extension and make a new account
5. Follow these instructions to set the MetaMask wallet on the Binance chain: [https://docs.binance.org/smart-chain/wallet/metamask.html](https://docs.binance.org/smart-chain/wallet/metamask.html)   thise step needs to be done, because the MetaMask wallet is pre-set to  work on the Ethereum network and we need to work on the Binance smart  chain
6. Open the MetaMask wallet and click on the top right circle
7. Select ""import account"" and there you paste your privite key

Then  you should see your balance in there. If I am not wrong, you could also  use the SeedPhrase instead of the private key and this would allow you  to skip the making of a new account, cause you would simply import the  whole thing.

CAKE EMISSION MODEL

&amp;#x200B;

\- 40 Cakes are generated per block ( in each 3 seconds )

&amp;#x200B;

From these 40 Cakes, 

&amp;#x200B;

\- 15 Cakes are going to be burned  (Burn pool)

&amp;#x200B;

\- 15 Cakes goes for —&gt; farmers and lottery 

&amp;#x200B;

\- 10 Cakes goes for —&gt;  Main Cake Pool stakers  

&amp;#x200B;

\---------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

Dev team does a massive burn weekly on every mondays that will consist of:

&amp;#x200B;

\- Lottery Burn ( 20% Cakes of Each Lottery pot burned )

&amp;#x200B;

\- Dev address ( Additionally daily %9.09 of Total generation is burned which is collected by lp fees -0.03% per swap- in DEX to dev wallet. )

&amp;#x200B;

\- Burn pool (emission reduction by 37.5% of total daily emission is burned -&gt; 15 Cakes per block are going to be burned )

&amp;#x200B;

\- If in that week an IFO raised, half of raised amount is CAKE and that portion goes for burning.

\---------------------------------

A1: I do believe they want to keep prices up, that's why the incentivized the burning of cakes, from lotteries or IFO. But in regard to staking cakes or LP, the reason they do it, is to keep liquidity in the pair of token. At the end Pancakeswap main business is the same of an Exchange, thus liquidity is necessary to trade.   


A2: As I said on A1, the exchange needs the liquidity and the pair in order to have a functional exchange. Some tokens are giving by the institution that creates them as it happened with xMark for example. But others are traded from other exchanges and placed into pancake. One way the do it is by creating the community governance, thus if you want a pair to come to the DEX then you would vote with your cake. I do believe that cake buys other currencies, but that is mainly done by the community as PS is decentralized.   


A3: With your Q3, you are also kind of answering Q2. As you noticed, they ask for liquidity of other coins, and the reason they do it is because it provides liquidity in the new pair for trading. As you said on A0, minting cake for them is almost at zero-cost ($0), thus, they pay back in cake. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now the next question you should be asking is why then cake has a value? and the reason is because people feels that it is worth that value. Why? because of different reasons, speculation, because it fills a market functionality as an exchange or AMM, or it could just be a pyramid scheme.

4219,[],Lopsided_Award7919,"Sure. The actual inflation rate of cake is above the roof as a result of the stupidly high apy rates. It’s similar to a central bank offering 15% returns on your savings account.. that would be a red flag that the economy is extremely unstable. The only reason anyone would buy cake is that someone else dumber than you will buy it for more, while the token itself has no real use or value(Definition of ponzi). 
As soon as cake’s token value starts declining because people realise it’s actually a completely useless token then we’ll see cake decline just as fast as it grew. 

Furthermore you would have to trust the developers A LOT before investing in cake because they have absurd amount of power for a crypto. First of all they left in the migrator code meaning they can steal all lp tokens no problem at all. The only thing stopping them is that cake price going up so they’ll wait till the end to dump. Furthermore, they have not burned the minting address which means they can EASILY mint and dump cake make hundreds of millions of $. This isn’t speculation or anything it’s a fact and you can see for yourself if you just read the smart contract. Many people are used to central authorities handling your money(banks), but personally i wouldn’t feel comfortable trusting a random anonymous team who have no idea what they’re doing. 

Also, cake has been a victim of an exploit in the past (SYRUP) and the hilarious part is that it happened AFTER their audit by certik. A lot of newbies think certik is an actual thing but the reality is they don’t give a fuck.. pretty much any garbage project can pay and that’s enough for newbies. If you really want to know if a project is safe read through the smart contract yourself, because clearly Certik are actual morons. The team was also extremely evasive about the issue and banned anyone on telegram who spoke about it. 

Lastly, just join the telegram group. You’ll see that even the mods are 15 year old idiots who think cake will hit $1,000 and ban anyone who speaks prices(if those prices &lt;$100).

Personally I prefer to have my money in cryptos where: 
1. Inflation rate isnt INSANELY high with founders who burn minuscule amounts to make idiots believe inflation isn’t that bad
2. I don’t need to worry about any central party just taking my staked tokens or minting and dumping. 
3. The token has an actual use case (does the dex really NEED cake to function as a dex? Not at all..)
4. It isn’t destined to fail once new investors stop coming in. 
5. Founders actually destroy the mint key. 

The day new investors stop joining this stupid ponzi scheme is the day all the newbies involved will lose majority of their value overnight, because as we said the only reason cake has value is that there’s is someone dumber out there willing to pay even more for it.",1615307880,t3_m0jwhb,t1_gqccqer,2,pancakeswap,0

What decides and optimal compound point? How does the AUTO multiplier work?  And if all that does in fact make sense, then why is it that EGG-WBNB is 850% APY on goose but on auto compared to egg-busd it has 30k fewer optimal compounds (42k total per year) and a 384k APY.

Didn't work. She told me she would open a ticket and have thw tech guys take a look.

I was litteraly signing off when I asked: ""Hey, is the bounty sale still going on?""..

&gt; Right now ETH and BNB are the 2 supported networks, so you can stake pairings like ADA-BNB or XRP-BNB, but they don't have an ADA-XRP pairing. Id assume they are getting after more in the future but PCS is a BNB backed institituion and ETH is the first mover so that's where its at. You do need to make sure your metamask is on the BSC to interact with PCS on BSC.  
  
I'm not really into staking, Is Panecakeswap for staking purpose only? Can I trade BNB for MEMETOKEN and hodl it?  
I see the contract of MEMETOKEN on etherscan. I suppose it's on Ethereum blockchain and I can store Memetoken on **Ethereum Mainnet** in **Metamask**?  
 
&gt; I don't see any OKB/anything pairings on PCS. Fees are generally low but for really odd coins you may have to set the slippage rate pretty high to get the trade to execute.   
  
Thanks  
  
&gt; Your coins belong to you, but when you stake them they 0 out in your metamask wallet, because the coins cannot be both staked and availaible to you to trade. You can unstake at anytime on PCS (no lockup) and the coins will reappear in your metamask wallet. If you have $100 fiat in your wallet, and want to put it in a bank to earn interest you can do that, but you cannot keep the $100 in your wallet AND have it in the savings account. Its yours either way, but its either in your wallet available to trade, or staked and not available to trade until you unstake it. Your key=your coin. Not your key=Not your coin.

Let's take an example of the CAKE pool. Current APR without compounding is 144%. If you compound per day, then you get 144 \* 2.71 = 390% effective APR.

So if you want to trade ETH and XRP... what you do is this:

 1. Send your ETH and XRP to Binance Smart Chain via the Binance Bridge ([https://www.binance.org/en/bridge](https://www.binance.org/en/bridge))

 2. You'll get ETH and XRP BEP20 tokens on Binance Smart Chain after the conversion, which you can access and use via MetaMask. On their native chains, the equivalent amounts of ETH and XRP are locked up so there's no duplication of the assets.

 3. You go to Pancake Swap, and trade the ETH and XRP tokens on Binance Smart Chain. You can trade as many time as you want, and the gas fees are much cheaper.

 4. When you desire to send the Binance Smart Chain ETH and XRP tokens back to their native chains, you can use Binance Bridge to do it again. Or, you can send them to Binance itself to convert to fiat if you like.

If you're a DeFi token on Ethereum, you can deploy peg / unpeg contracts on both Ethereum side and Binance Smart Chain side via the ""Token Canal"" contracts ([https://github.com/binance-chain/token-canal-project](https://github.com/binance-chain/token-canal-project)) to enable 1:1 convertibility between Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain tokens.",1613296352,t3_ljkdta,t3_ljkdta,1,pancakeswap,0

So you could put in 1 ETH at $1000 and $1000 BUSD but when you withdraw your LP token you might only get 0.75 ETH if the value of ETH is $2000 and you'd get about 1500 BUSD.

I'll assume you have done that or I'll paste a link here [docs.binance.org › smart-chain › wallet › metamask](https://docs.binance.org/smart-chain/wallet/metamask.html)

OK, now how I did it.

Get a [Binance.us](https://Binance.us) account. ---&gt;Send Eth to your [Binance.us](https://Binance.us) account and then convert to BNB ---&gt;Send BNB to your Binance Chain Wallet (download it quick, works kinda like metamask) using the BIP20 address of your Binance Chain Wallet  --&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Then the tricky part...once the BNB arrives in your Binance Chain Wallet you need to send it from there to your metamask. So...Using your Binance chain wallet, send the BNB to the address that is your metamask address (the 'click to copy' link at the top of your metamask, should be an erc20 or eth address I think).

Now it's in your metamask when you've selected the binance smart chain as the network. It will still use the ETH symbol, it might even call them ETH, but they are BNB and you can use them to interact with Pancake Swap and buy cake and berries.

I am just a potato but I live in the US and this worked for me. Will it work for you? I don't know. Did I forget something important? Maybe. I will proofread it again after I post it. .

Yes,  your earning is based on the combined value of your investment, both your UST and mAMZN, so yes, IF the earning rate of 300% remained constant for the year, your yield would be $30k.

As values fluctuate, you may lose out on the value of one of the tokens as you have described. There is a good article on how this can happen here: [https://blog.bancor.network/beginners-guide-to-getting-rekt-by-impermanent-loss-7c9510cb2f22](https://blog.bancor.network/beginners-guide-to-getting-rekt-by-impermanent-loss-7c9510cb2f22)

So, yes, your worst case scenario is essentially correct. Though, you also have value fluctuations of the tokens that constantly change as well as the APY that constantly changes. So both of those things can contribute to it being significantly lower. Eg, the value of mAMZN drops to 2.5k AND the APY drops to 50%. Now your investment of 10k is worth $7.5k and is only earning 50%. The APY may go up again, and the value of the tokens may go up too. Or they may go down more.

The reason why I consider Farming is because of the teck-stock coins, like amazon, tesla. Which claims to give a \~300APY which would be amazing, but I did actually not understand what does APY mean... still... 

lets say I got 10k $, then I buy each token (USD backed and Amazon) with little less than 5k each. Now I add it to the lequidity pool:

I end up with 5,000 UST and 1.34958 mAMZN. Which holds then a current value of 10k$.

So would I get 300% on UST and 300% on mAMZN. If  the price stay's on the current value I end up with 13k $.

\_

Now we can predict that the price of mAMZN changes -&gt; tomorrow price drops 50% and stays there the whole year.

 I will end up getting money for the current value of the mAMZN token 2,5k\*3 APY + 5,k\*3 APY = 7,5k + 15k = 22,5k. Just the payout for providing liquidity. And then I also can keep the value of the tokens -&gt; 22,5k + 2,5k+ 5k =30k ?

&amp;#x200B;

5831,[],No-Job-6017,"There are two different ways this can happen.

1.Yields will be reducing naturally as more people stake their cakes. As long as minting volume is stable, the rewards are spread thinner and thinner, cause more people will be eating from the same pool. This alone does not affect price itself, as the produced coin volume is stable. More popularity brings less rewards. Less popularity provides higher rewards. Its an equilibrium that will find it's balance in the future.

2.Minting volume gets reduced by force. This is typically being done so far with voting between cake holders, so you do have insight on the incoming result before it occurs.
This method would probably have the opposite immediate effect of what you fear, it would cause an increase in price, as the reduced volume causes token scarcity (deflation).
This approach is not likely to be abused in the near future, as the coin still needs to be attractive to new investors, but will be definetely needed at some point to control the inflation of an uncapped coin. 

Both of these events are healthy, they provide stability and longevity to the currency.

You are worried in the wrong direction.
Your main concerns as a crypto investor are these:

Can they just drop the ball and run with the money?
Will the coin provide value on which it will sustain it's growth, or will it always be dependant on new investors to feed itself to implosion.

The only thing, on my opinion, they can do is to change incentives from farms/pools to simply redistributing extra fees they've generated to Cake holder, based on respected user holdings. So make CAKE supply capped, as shares on financial market, and redistribute extra fees among shareholder. A lot of exchanges  previously had done that, so its not like reinventing a wheel.

since PancakeSwap gains some traction lately (and I really like it!), I spent the past two days crafting this guide on how to use it in the easiest and most accessible way. 

I tried to write this guide in a way that is easy to digest even for beginners who have zero experience with cryptocurrencies.

I originally work in the Cybersecurity industry and I mentor folks over there, so I kind of know how to make a complicated topic easy to understand (I hope, at least).

Please let me know your feedback or if anything needs changing, I'm happy to do so!

There is also a video coming out later today. I mainly create beginner-friendly crypto guides, so if you'd like to check out my stuff, check out my [YouTube channel](https://www.crypto-made-easy.com/YouTube) and my [Blog](https://www.crypto-made-easy.com).

Pools will have lower returns because 1) you get less percentage of the transaction fees and 2) the total value in the syrup pool is much larger, than say a CAKE-BNB LP, meaning your share % is much lower.

It's a little hard for me to explain since I kind of just barely understand it but essentially when you stake an LP token like cake-bnb, upon unstaking there's a chance that you receive a different ratio than the one you put in. Like if you put in a 20 to 1 ratio of cake to bnb. And the price of bnb drops or rises when you go to withdraw let's say bnb has dropped in price so when you on stake you might get 24 cake and 0.8 bnb.

Better app, unlimited withdrawals, CLT (their version of NEXO tokens) gives you extra percentage points but you don't have to maintain 10% balance of their tokens, so no matter how much crypto you have, you still get the bonus points. Nexo also recently started changing their rules regarding withdrawals and reducing the number of free ones as well as now you have to pay the tx fee. They also reduced yield percentages across the board by 1% without any notice. I sold most of my NEXO after moving my crypto out and having less to maintain the 10% to remain platinum. I'll keep them around since I'm interested in the Nexo crypto spending Mastercard, but I stopped using them for the most part. CoinLoan gives you higher APY on most everything. They also support Monero, which I can't find any others that do.

They do have some disadvantages vs Nexo though. They don't share the 30% revenue dividends with CLT holders like Nexo. Nexo also pays out you your interest daily, whereas CoinLoan does it once per month (it still accrues daily). They also have a spot wallet, and an interest savings wallet. It's instant to go from spot wallet to savings, but takes a day to go from savings to spot wallet when you want to withdraw. Not so good if you are in a hurry to sell. All-in-all CoinLoan wins for me with the tradeoffs.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Your LP Token goes into the pool at a 50/50 and doesn't gain value within the pool. 

Are you suggesting that the $ value of an LP token cannot increase at all? That is false. 

Impermanent loss refers to the difference between what you -could- have made by holding, not the difference between what you -started- with. 

If the price of one token gains 50% and the other stays the same, you take a 2% IL and profit 48%. 

[https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/impermanent-loss-explained](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/impermanent-loss-explained)

The [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/advanced-topics/understanding-returns) docs offers these equations for calculating the size of the ETH pool  at various prices: 

* eth\_liquidity\_pool = sqrt(constant\_product / eth\_price) 
* token\_liquidity\_pool = sqrt(constant\_product \* eth\_price)

Plugging values into the equation for eth\_price (as they did in the docs) plainly shows how IL works. You still profit, but slightly less than if you were to hold. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;If both coins go up 500% you'll see an adjustment within your liquidity stack that brings it back to your original pledge

What do you mean by ""original pledge""? Your initial deposit in USD? So if you deposit BNB and BTC and they both 5x, the AMM takes 4/5th of it? Why? 

I'm fairly certain that the only thing that results in impermanent loss is if the value ratio between the two coins change between deposit and withdrawal. 

If both coins go up 500% the ratio between them in USD value remains the same, so how can IL occur?

In a LP Pool with two non-stablecoin tokens the equations for their pool size ought to be:

* eth\_liquidity\_pool = sqrt(constant\_product \* (token\_price/eth\_price)) 
* token\_liquidity\_pool = sqrt(constant\_product \* (eth\_price/token\_price)) 

If the price of both tokens appreciated 5x, that 5x would just be cancelled out in this equation. No impermanent loss would occur. 

 You can verify this with this IL calculator I found:

you do not need to send your funds to a MetaMask wallet. You need to understand that your funds are not linked to your wallet, but they are linked to your address and the adress can be open with different wallets. Instead of sending your funds from BNCwallet to the MetaMask one, you simply need to open your address with MetaMask.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1. Open you Binance wallet
2. Below your balance, click on the three orizontal dots and then click ""export private key""
3. Copy the private key
4. Install the MetaMask extension and make a new account
5. Follow these instructions to set the MetaMask wallet on the Binance chain: [https://docs.binance.org/smart-chain/wallet/metamask.html](https://docs.binance.org/smart-chain/wallet/metamask.html)   thise step needs to be done, because the MetaMask wallet is pre-set to  work on the Ethereum network and we need to work on the Binance smart  chain
6. Open the MetaMask wallet and click on the top right circle
7. Select ""import account"" and there you paste your privite key

Then  you should see your balance in there. If I am not wrong, you could also  use the SeedPhrase instead of the private key and this would allow you  to skip the making of a new account, cause you would simply import the  whole thing.

after sometime you will end up with 0.01:99.9% if you remove liquidity, because everyone is dumping ShitcoinX for your BNB.
But on the other hand, if this coin goes through the roof, you will end up with more BNB because everyone is buying this other coin.

Using LP token will have impermanent loss if you don't take proper care of it. When BNB or CAKE price has a large price change, this would cause impermanent loss when you remove LP token. Because LP token is composed of equal value of both coins, either one coin price goes up or down will change the amount you put in.  For example, we assume BNB and CAKE has the same price, so 1 LP = 1BNB+1CAKE. after some time CAKE price go up but BNB doesn't, your 1LP will become &gt;1BNB+&lt;1CAKE when you remove the token back to coin. So you actually lose some CAKE.

And this is also why some LP pairs have so high APY, because the impermanent loss is also potentially higher.
Staking CAKE only won't have this impermanent loss, so I personally think is better in this case.",1616916637,t3_mew4ua,t1_gsk5whn,1,pancakeswap,0

6802,[],cryptoshadow2,"First: that 526 refers to a year, so divide it by 365 to get the daily amount. Second: look up impermanent loss: say you put 100 of coin A and 100 of coin B (through an LP). When you create it, it is worth 200 USD (a and b are both 1 USD). In time, their value (might) change. What could happen is, for example, that coin B explodes (10x). So you'd expect to have 100+1000 now, right? Wrong. You still have 200 worth in a combo of the two tokens. Therefore, if you just sat on your coin you'd be way richer. This is not guaranteed to happen though, and you have to look at every particular case to understand the exact calculations. Long story short: higher risk - try it with a few hundreds worth and if it all goes sideways... You paid for your education.

Step 2: Go to Tools-&gt;Script Editor

Paste this in, replacing YOURWALLETADDRESS with your actual 0x... wallet address.

 

`function CAKELPPRICE(){`  
 `var header = {`  
 `""Accept"":""application/json""`  
    `};`   
 `var options = {`  
 `""method"" : ""GET"",`

 `var w = JSON.parse(response.getContentText());`  
 `return w.result.PancakeSwap.LPStaking.vaults[0].LPInfo.priceInUSDLPToken;`  
`}`

Now, back in your spreadsheet, put this in a cell

=CAKELPPRICE()

Voila, real-time data. It shoud update when you change or save the spreadsheet. It can be a bit flaky, when I want to force an update I set that cell to 0 and repaste the =CAKELPPRICE().

One thing you may need to change is the vaults\[0\] to some other # than 0, it depends on how many vaults you are running. If you want to you can dig into the API response by setting a breakpoint on the line that starts 'return' (set a breakpoint by hovering to the left of the line # and clicking, you will see a purple circle fill in). With a breakpoint set press 'debug' in the top menu bar. It will run the function and pause on that line and show you the data it got back in the right pane. Open the item named 'w' and drill down to see which vault you want.

In this way you can create functions for your different vaults and see them all. I use these to calculate my actual principal value in real-time without having to manual update stuff.

* Buy some ETH from Coinbase.
* Transfer it to an ETH wallet that you own, like MetaMask.
* Then use Binance Bridge to transfer that ETH from your ETH wallet to another BSC wallet.

That's it. Now you can do whatever you want on PancakeSwap.

On apps like bunny and auto farm they automatically reinvest your rewards at optimized times to increase your APY which increases your APR and ROI. Take the cake pool on PCS, it has an APY of around 100%. On Bunny it is about 300%. The reason is that they reinvest your rewards a couple times a day. On Bunny they also allow you to manually claim your rewards anytime you want and when you do they take 30% of the cake and replace it with Bunny. Since cake is about $25 and BUNNY is like $350-450 usually the amount of BUNNY rewards quickly overtakes the cake rewards it becomes more profitable to manually claim once every week or two so you can get that more expensive Bunny to either invest in bunny pools or to convert to cake and reinvest in cake pools.",1618814414,t3_mtuhki,t1_gv1ymud,1,pancakeswap,0

When asked about it, the devs said that code is necessary for any platform that may need to change the token in the future. Like, when they had SYRUP and had to convert them to CAKE when they removed them. Without that code, they couldn't have done that, but it's also possible to use it to just take all the value staked by converting tokens over to others. That alone isn't suspicious, but the dev team is also anonymous and there was one bug that made it past the 'audit' that was done on the code, which caused the aforementioned pulling of SYRUP. Someone had found a bug that let them pull out their SYRUP without unstaking their CAKE, and made off with a bunch of money before it got fixed.

Solution:

\- Make sure ledger live is upto date and all your apps in ledger live is also updated.

\- Close ledger live

\- Close you browser

\- Connect ledger to laptop

\- Unlock your ledger using pin number

\- Open the ethereum app on the ledger, under contract data make sure it is set to ""allowed""

\- Open the ethereum app on the ledger and make sure it is set on ""application is ready""

\- Now open your browser

\- Sign into metamask and connect ledger

\- Proceed with contracts, approve them as normal

\- Check your ledger and make sure to approve any contracts that pop up on the ledger.

Following these steps should fix your problem with ""stalled out transactions"" on metamask while your ledger is connected.

There are 2 aspects of that

First is the fact that they are paying in Cake, which has ""no cost"" or very little cost to the exchange because this coin was created for this matter in specific.

and second and most important the actual value or money is coming from the fees that are paid by the people doing the swaps, whenever you swap any coin there is very small fee paid by the users doing the swap a portion of those fees goes to the pool liquidity providers which then gets transfer to you as a liquidity provider in the proportion that you added liquidity.

Basically the more trading that is happening around a specific pair vs the amount of liquidity that that pair has, and other factors defines the amount of return that each pool gets.

The goal is to keep the Cake and BNB at a fixed ratio to profit off trading between them. When the ratio changes, the system sells one coin and buys the other to even out the ratio of value in the liquidity pools. If the ratio changes back, it trades back for a net profit.

I seem to be losing out each time. There is currently a BNB/GUM liquidity farm on Pancakesawp. I put in just over 5.5 BNB in with 1800 GUM. 

BNB has gone up since and GUM has gone down. Now i thought if i would come out of this farm and converted back my LP coins to the original assets i would get less BNB and more GUM but still equal to the value of what i put in first. BUT when i go to do it, it currently says i would get back 3.5 BNB and only 650 GUM!!!!

And ultimately, you're relatively early. Pancake's been around for less than 6 months, and it's pretty complicated to get money on the BSC to purchase and stake cake (I've had to walk multiple software devs through all the steps of getting eth to cake). So the amount of people staking is relatively low. In a few months, if crypto hasn't all crashed a lot more people will be in the pool (and emission may have been reduced) so the APRs will be lower.

After a week LINA went up 50%. Your friend now has 750$ of LINA and 500$ of BUSD. You would think you have the same + the liquidite fees, but the way yield farming works is you always hold the same amount of both currenciea. In this case you would have less profit, because when LINA price rises you now have less LINA and more BUSD (to make the value of your liquidity equal on both coins).

Comparing both persons, your friend now has 1250$ while you would have 1225$, so the impermanent loss would be 25$ (even though you won 125$).

I'm guessing you lost some money because LINA price went down, because impermanent loss only happens if prices go up, thus on profits (or diminishes losses).

Farming means you are providing liquidity and by staking those LP tokens you get cake.

Staking means you just buy cakes and stake them in the syrup pools section in whichever pool you like to stake, while staking cake you either earn cake or other tokens from the pools and it has only price fluctuations risk and no impermanent loss risk

&amp;#x200B;

also 40x, it's just the reward multiplier

&amp;#x200B;

so 40x farms have 40 times more rewards of 1x farms and 20 times more than 2x farms (per block) etc.

I can tell you for sure that you can stake/unstake at any time. It's instant, too. The fee for doing these actions is roughly .002 BNB currently. If you compare that fee to the fees on other DeFi exchanges, you will be quite pleased with it. You can add a pair of tokens to a liquidity pool, like BNB+CAKE, to get LP (liquidity pool) tokens. Then, you can put these LP tokens in a yield farm to generate CAKE for yourself. You can withdraw the LP tokens at any time and convert them back into BNB+CAKE, or whatever token pair you chose. When you are providing liquidity, you must provide an equal value of the two tokens you choose. For example, the BNB+CAKE liquidity pool requires that you put in roughly 15 CAKE per 1 BNB, based on current prices. Besides liquidity pools, you can also straight up stake CAKE on its own to also earn a very high interest rate.

So what is the intrinsic value of CAKE? Well, if you think PancakeSwap is a good project, then you should also think that CAKE has a lot of potential. They're tied together, since CAKE is required to use PancakeSwap. If one does well the other will also do well. Personally, I believe in PancakeSwap 100%. It is cheaper and faster than its main competitors, UniSwap and SushiSwap. Plus, it's easy and fun to use. It is also backed by Binance, which is one of the largest exchanges worldwide. If Binance believes in PancakeSwap, then why shouldn't I?  That's my thinking, at least.

I still have some questions about CAKE that maybe someone else can answer:

* What is the inflation rate of CAKE and what is the inflation mechanism?
* How was CAKE originally circulated?
* What are the yield farm APRs based on? Is it based on the value of the LP tokens and the value of CAKE?
* Why is it that staking CAKE gets roughly the same APR as yield farming? Why should I choose one over the other?
* What happened to Syrup? I guess it used to be a governance token that stopped being used?",1614179747,t3_ljmdow,t3_ljmdow,1,pancakeswap,0

The extra trades I was referring to is all the swaps and transfers I had to go through to get my stuff onto BSC and then figure out how to make LP tokens, stake them, and then harvest and compound everyday. It’s adding tons of transactions that are hard to keep track of for taxes. 

But it’s been fun staking and watching these crazy APYs in action. And with yieldwatch I’m able to monitor the IL that is occurring and so far it seems negligible. Even with the slight IL that it is showing (-0.18%) my amount of LP tokens has been increasing, in addition to the value of the coins they are representing. 

To answer your original question.. No, IL is not outweighing my gains, presumably due to the fact that the coins I have it paired with are rising at an equally explosive rate.

The best to describe this is through a simplistic example. Let’s say the bnb-cake pool currently consists of 10 bnb and 100 cake. You then add 10 bnb and 100 cake to the pool. The pool now consists of 20 bnb and 200 cake. Your contribution to the pool represents 50% (your contribution corresponds to your LP tokens). The next day you withdrawal your contribution from the pool (I.e. redeem your LP tokens). When you withdrawal, you get 50% of the pool’s bnb and 50% of the pool’s cake (assuming no one else has added or withdrawn from the pool). The amount of crypto that 50% represents can change as trading occurs and makeup of the pool changes. So let’s say now the pool consists of 10 bnb and 400 cake (change is primarily due to trading that has occurred over the past day). Your withdrawal would be 50% of the pool - so you’d get 5 bnb and 200 cake. 

That is an overly simplistic example with many assumptions - as many times these liquidity pools are growing, so your contribution continually gets proportionally smaller compared to the entire pool as whole (which is why LP tokens exist - as those represent your “share” of the pool).",1614271666,t3_ls4poe,t1_goptux7,5,pancakeswap,1

So, a better question might be what is the driving demand for PancakeSwap itself? PancakeSwap is useful, in my opinion, because it's better than its competitors. It does essentially the same thing as UniSwap or SushiSwap, yet it's much cheaper and faster because it uses the Binance smart chain rather than Ethereum. On top of that, UniSwap and SushiSwap have much bigger market caps, which means that PancakeSwap has a lot of room to grow if it does take off.

Unfortunately there isn't a help option on pancake being its decentralized exchange.

Since its not in either wallet the option of hitting max on autofarm to fund the coins isn't available.  Pic on autofarm

I know I created the combo token I just can't figure out where it got sent to where I can use it.  I don't see an option in either BSC wallet or Metamask to see what coins are staked.  I thought  that may have happened and just not easy to see.

ok and now: comparing liquidity in DeFi of some random pair of coins you have never heard of before is crypto-risk times 1000. This is not for the crypto beginner. 
If you want the safest kind of Liquidity, it’s USDT-USDC LP but it is still DeFi(high risk) on PCS which is high risk itself, which is trading in crypto (another high risk).
so as a beginner don’t expect to get rich safely on a 100$ investment in a DeFi liquidity pool. 

oh and btw if anyone tells you: buy this coin on PCS but you have to adjust slippage to 10-20%. this is crazy. that means you just get 20% less the coin but you spend 100% of your money. my advice is: only get into coins that have proven at least some form of use or something.

For the use cases of a liquidity provider, I personally try to put 

a) majority in the main LP pair, because I believe in both coins (the impermanent loss I take as risk of doing business as LP, but i think both coins ll gain in value and I don't care that much about their relative performance, which is the balance of both coins on payday) 

b) minority in some promising pairs, which will reward also in the main coin from the platform, which is fine for me as I goes with the above. So this pair may be called platform coin paired with a *shitcoin*. The risk or potential is that the relative value of the shitcoin outperforms the platform coin, so on payday relatively more platform coins than initially staked. Not that bad, and also cheap *shitcoins* in the end. 

so what to do with the rewards coming in from providing liquidity?

c) Those harvests frequently are put in pools, either the platform coin pool or some promising *shitcoin* with high apy (maybe participate on the start with &gt;1000% for a day) 

d) or are split up and paired with another *shitcoin* (go back to point b)

9664,[],Bubbly-Gear-7827,"Farms: if you deposit 2 types of coin,  you dont own the amount what you deposited, you own a percantage of a pool. For example: you put 100bnb and 1000 something noname shitcoin, because this has equal value in money. This means your deposit is 50%-50%. But if the shitcoin's price decreasing and the bnb raise the pool adjust the amont of the coins for the original value. So now your original deposit looks like ex:40%shitcoin - 50% bnb (original: 1000pc- 100pc)  The system correct the amount and now you will have 1500pc shitcoin and 80bnb. So basically at the current moment the value you have is okay but the shitcoin much more probable to go down in value, and now you lost amount of bnb (100pc to 80pc) Of course the method goes with the other direction when bnb goes down and the other up. In this case the amount of bnb of yours will go up the other down.                                                          Pools: the only thing is affecting your reward when the price of the coin goes down. Example: you buy 100cake at 15$. You put it into a 100% apy pool. In this case your estimated revenue if the apy stays át around 100 in the whole year is 3000$. This means your deposit worth 100*15$=1500$. But if the cake falls down to 10$ that means you will receive 100cake at the end in summary. But that 200pc cake will only worth 2000$ instead of the expected 3000$  at the start. Of course if the price of the cake skyrocket, than your profit will be as well. Cake goes 20$ and you will have 200 at the end this means 4000$ in value.

The unfortunate fact is that new people are entering daily, and may not be as detail oriented. Also they don't fully understand how LPs work and the revolving door of these scams take full advantage.

If you can avoid the traps, farming on BSC can be very lucrative. I don't want to give the wrong impression that everything on BSC is a scam. I stick with legitimate platforms such as  [autofarm.network](https://autofarm.network/), [beefy.finance](https://beefy.finance), and [belt.fi](https://belt.fi).

From what I can tell, Pancakebunny stakes your cake on pancakeswap but autocompounds it for more efficient returns. You could do the same thing on pancakeswap but you would have to calculate the best time to compound your cake depending on fees... it’s basically a lot of extra work, and pancake bunny does it automatically.

Notice that PCSwap is APR and PCBunny is APY

APR is yearly interest without considering compounding, whilst APY is an effective yearly return.

From what I can tell, it’s completely legitimate, but as usual, make sure you do some extra research

Edit: and to answer your question, I suppose the big drawback is that you have to stake for a minimum of 3 days or pay a 0.5% fee (so they don’t lose out paying you more than what you actually earned before they can start compounding).

Unless you're using an hardware wallet like Ledger with the BNB app installed, in which case it should be the BEP2 (Binance Chain) version.

But ask for help on the chat. And then start with a small amount to make sure it's working. That way if anything goes wrong your loss is minimal.

I have been waiting over a month for identity verification, but there are reports it can take several months. I bought the UNI just because I saw that pancakeSwap appears to have an exchange pair from UNI to CAKE.

I also looked at moving the UNI to [binance.us](https://binance.us) because I can trade crypto, but the problem is that UNI is only paired with USD and I don't think I can trade for USD without validation, so if that doesn't work, I would just have to pull it back out and likely end up with more fees. Also, UNI/USD is the only exchange pair in [binance.us](https://binance.us) so I can't exchange with another crypto.

It does not seem like you can exchange from UNI to CAKE  on pancakeSwap though because it only connects to one wallet with one wallet address at a time, but it seems like you would need two addresses, one for ETH and one for BNB for an exchange to happen.

Another obstacle I am seeing is that it looks like you really need at least a small amount of BNB for gas fees in order to exchange on pancakeSwap, so it looks like you can't really do anything there until there is at least some BNB in your wallet.

At this point, I might just leave the UNI there, but I still want to buy CAKE and need a way to buy BNB in the US.",1617743283,t3_ml8t60,t1_gtk39hi,1,pancakeswap,0

I don't really know which is the best place to stake (if you are referring to a pool or a platform).

I'm staking lien-bnb and cake-bnb. You don't need to be locked into a specific time frame. You can take the tokens and coins whenever you like. You will loose money if the values for the coins change obviously but that's volatility.

Bonds don't need to be held for a specific amount of time, even though you get paid at the end you can sell the bond for a price which would be similar to the interests accrued so far.

My recommendation would also be: Do a few experiments and add liquidity to an interesting LP pool - not big, more like 10dollar and see how it 'feels' and study.

10390,[],yprivacymatter,"pertaining to your question about whats going on in the LP, network validation and DeFi in general, here’s a quick summary:

1. don’t confuse LP/ PancakeSwap for network validation (bnb/eth/etc paid as gas to network validators)
2. You can see PancakeSwap as a service/protocol, sort of like a money changer, just that the physical person is replaced by smart contracts (trustless)
3. your LP is basically the liquidity (crypto assets provided in pairs for this case because it is AMM mechanism) that facilitates the crypto asset swapping on-chain (aka DeFi)
4. as to how you get such returns on providing liquidity; think of it as PCS needs to incentivise users to first provide liquidity so that their main product (aka the crypto money changer) works with low slippage
5. crypto’s valuation should not be confused with normal stocks method of valuation (assets based); crypto is more of the function and utility of the service/protocol/project that serves to meet a growing demand/need in the market",1617005310,t3_mfixzp,t1_gsnztb5,1,pancakeswap,0

So rather than 70% + ""30%"" in bunny, if we look at it in USD perspective, its 70% + 108% (bunny).

108 comes from 30% x 3.6 (ratio of 5 bunny to 1 bnb)

1. on [Coinbase.com](https://Coinbase.com) Buy litecoin via debit card  
2. Send from Coinbase to your [binance.us](https://binance.us) wallet (make sure its the native litceoin address and not the BEP20)  
3. On [BInance.US](https://BInance.US)  sell your ltc for USDT  
4. ON [binance.us](https://binance.us), buy BNB using your USDT  
5. From [Binance.us](https://Binance.us) send your bnb to your bnb trust wallet address  
6. On Trust Wallet, go to your BNB, click in and click the three dot icons for More  
7. Swap to Smart Chain, swap your BNB to the smart chain BNB (the icon background is black)  
8. In Trust Wallet, go to DApps, under DeFi go to PancakeSwap ( I heard there are issues if you are on IoS, but this works without issue on Android)  
9. Connect your wallet on the top right   
10. Go to Exchange, you should have a BNB balance, enter in BNB amount or click MAX  
11. Select Pancake and do the swap, you should now own CAKE!",1617225514,t3_mgxnlp,t3_mgxnlp,1,pancakeswap,0

2. Create an exchange where people buy cake with their bnb first(making it almost pegged to bnb)
3. Create a program which says stake cake get 150% apr (for doing absolutely nothing.. not even validating blocks literally its a joke)

10929,[],Sarafan,"You are misunderstanding. Liquidity stays the same (the product of your two tokens), the ratio of their values does NOT. If one token changes in value by a lot in relation to the other (as you have mentioned in your example of 600%), your losses can be quite high. You would have been better off hodling.

Here is the example from binance academy:

&gt;Alice deposits 1 ETH and 100 DAI in a liquidity pool. In this particular automated market maker (AMM), the deposited token pair needs to be of equivalent value. This means that the price of ETH is 100 DAI at the time of deposit. This also means that the dollar value of Alice’s deposit is 200 USD at the time of deposit.

&gt;In addition, there’s a total of 10 ETH and 1,000 DAI in the pool – funded by other LPs just like Alice. So, Alice has a 10% share of the pool, and the total liquidity is 10,000.

&gt;Let’s say that the price of ETH increases to 400 DAI. While this is happening, arbitrage traders will add DAI to the pool and remove ETH from it until the ratio reflects the current price. Remember, AMMs don’t have order books. What determines the price of the assets in the pool is the ratio between them in the pool. While liquidity remains constant in the pool (10,000), the ratio of the assets in it changes.

&gt;If ETH is now 400 DAI, the ratio between how much ETH and how much DAI is in the pool has changed. There is now 5 ETH and 2,000 DAI in the pool, thanks to the work of arbitrage traders.

&gt;So, Alice decides to withdraw her funds. As we know from earlier, she’s entitled to a 10% share of the pool. As a result, she can withdraw 0.5 ETH and 200 DAI, totaling 400 USD. She made some nice profits since her deposit of tokens worth 200 USD, right? But wait, what would have happened if she simply holds her 1 ETH and 100 DAI? The combined dollar value of these holdings would be 500 USD now.

&gt;We can see that Alice would have been better off by HODLing rather than depositing into the liquidity pool. This is what we call impermanent loss. In this case, Alice’s loss wasn’t that substantial as the initial deposit was a relatively small amount. Keep in mind, however, that impermanent loss can lead to big losses (including a significant portion of the initial deposit).",1613213612,t3_lims8g,t1_gn6lzaz,1,pancakeswap,0

I'm not sure if you understand that link, most recent miners are profitable. Top of the list earns 170 USD a day.

&gt; If it's more costly to mine, shouldn't the price of BTC continue to rise?

Right, it's intended to be deflationary. But that still means it's worth to produce more, it's just harder. 

&gt; There's a finite amount of BTC. 

Which will not be reached until 2170, as the difficulty increases in such a way that a new block will keep taking 10 minutes to mine. True, still finite, but on a timescale that it makes hardly sense to compare it to coins/tokens of which a finite amount is already in circulation, or which is produced on a scale of a few years.

&gt; AMM 'stocks' aren't finite. 

This isn't true, contracts can be defined to be infinite but most aren't. Otherwise the token will be inflationary, hence not worth investing and thus it will attract less value (mostly just hype/dumb money).

&gt; There's a finite amount of gold in the earth. That's why I use the comparison.

There's a finite amount of any element in the earth, however no one would argue to trade silicon. Nor do people generally keep cerium or antimony bars in their vault. Gold has a very strong appeal from its traditional use as a currency, partly connected to its looks. Just because people liked to use it in the past doesn't exactly provide an argument for its *intrinsic* value, it holds practical value. At this moment.

That's how they can offer such high APR initially, to drive interest in their token and make it back in the long run. The fees they collect alone aren't adding up to enough to cover all high APR% they are offering. They are banking on a large portion of the people holding their CAKE until they've grown enough that the values equal back out. We're effectively loaning them money at a very high interest rate.

So, the early adopters get paid to help build it up, then the rates lower as others join. In some ways, it's kind of a mini ponzi scheme, but it levels out and reaches profitability unlike a real ponzi.   
Another way to think of it, is we're kinda loan sharks to the exchange. We're loaning them money at very high interest rates, and they are banking on growing big enough to pay back that money later. Especially since, they are mostly paying us in an asset that isn't backed by something else. That's why every swap has their own token, if the company's growth stagnated, the token's value could plummet. But, the more people that want that token, the more valuable it becomes and the easier it is to pay back the liquidity providers with it.

So, hypothetically, a $1000 total value split between coin A and coin B at a ratio of 1:1, meaning $500 worth of each coin at time you provided them, could be returned to you as $1000 at a ratio of 3:1 meaning $750 of coin A and $250 of coin B. You dont lose any of your initial investment provided you bought the coins on the way in and sold them on the way out. Any profit you make is on exchange fees and farming rates.

Had I bought $500 worth of coin A and $500 worth of coin B held for the same period of time. The rise in price of coin A that caused the change of  ratio in the pool would return more than the original underlying value when I sold. I would instead have $1250. But, I wouldn't have any profits from fees, nor would I have any CAKE. Whether or not atvthis point I would be in profit or loss would depend on the fee rates, farming APR, and time staked. 

Please correct me if I'm wrong.

What I was suggesting is at this point perhaps you had identified market circumstances favourable to coin B that you might like to trade A for B at the same value of the IL. In this case the new ratio works in your favour, no? And if your assessment of the market was correct and coin B increased in value bringing your total holdings above $250 then what was, at the time you left the pool, a loss relative to coin A would become profit relative to coin B.

That was all. Of course your reading of coin B's chart etc could be wrong and you compound your loss on A with a loss B too. That wasn't the point I was making though.

Go back and click link beside token tracker “pancake lps”

And you’ll see total supply 4 million Lp tokens

Now you take both token totals divide them by 4 million

Works out around 5 cake/0.25  wbnb.

If you know the price of cake or bnb then you can calculate the price of the LP around $210

* PancakeBunny has auto-compounding built-in *for some farming* (not all) so you don't have to hit the compound button or harvest and re-stake. Check below the interest rate for the words ""Auto Compounding"".  If there is an ""i"" next to the interest rate, hover on that to read the note, and for those that require *manual compounding*, I've found the fees involved take away the purported value. Every time you make a change, there is a fee involved, keep that in mind. Granted on BSC it's a much smaller fee but a fee nonetheless. 
* PancakeBunny will offer a higher yield and provides you with the dollar amount your investment is currently worth. 
* There is a risk. Less risky are the Pools (one token deposit). The farms are usually a combination of two tokens which can go very wrong if one tanks or one soars. When farming with paired tokens, this risk is called *""impermanent loss""* and becomes more probable when pooling un-correlated assets with high volatility.  *Impermanent loss* happens when you provide liquidity to a liquidity pool, and the price of your deposited assets greatly changes compared to when you deposited them. 
* Take note there is a 30% performance fee on PancakeBunny farms, too. But if you compare PancakeSwap to PancakeBunny, the CAKE Pool APR on PancakeSwap might be 112% whereas on PancakeBunny it is 364%, so even after shaving off 30% you're still earning more than double by using PancakeBunny.",1616975267,t3_lpiju4,t1_goc8zsx,1,pancakeswap,0

“Probably made a mistake while swapping, can someone explain, please?

Hi guys,

Few days ago I decided to play a little with shitcoin. For the first time I used dxsale for pre-sale, set-up Metamask on BSC Smart Chain, connected Metamask with dxsale and purchased token successfully. 

Then the token was put on pancakeswap and after some time I decided today to swap it back to BNB. Swap was successful but probably I have made some mistake. The current situation looks like this:

1) I cant see the amount of BNB I should have received but still can see original amount of that token.

2) I can still see on pancakeswap the original amount of token so I have tried to swap once again but it says something about insufficient amount which makes sense as the first swap was successful.

3) When I check holders of that token, there is still my amount so it looks like I havent sold/swap it yet somehow. 

Can someone please explain/help? Here is bscscan: [https://bscscan.com/tx/0xa56da776499abb0956ee8c99d29699dd74b9a081f1e3ce459ea8b88a3b483118](https://bscscan.com/tx/0xa56da776499abb0956ee8c99d29699dd74b9a081f1e3ce459ea8b88a3b483118)

12106,[],Antonio97x,"I can only answer question 1 and 4, 
1-the % of BNB needs to be equal to the % of CAKE or any other coin you are planning on staking, lets say you want to stake 1,000 USD so buy 500 worth of BNB and 500 worth of CAKE, in short words, you need the same amount of BNB then the pair. 
4-If you lower the gas fee two things can happen, your transaction will take longer to process or it will never process, how can it be possible that it will never process? Well if the amount is too small they will always give priority to the other transactions and you will never be able to get into the line. Usually there are websites that suggest an amount of gass depending on your needs, this websites give you 3 recommended gas fee amounts depending your needs, 5=safe transaction but it will take 30min, 8=safe transaction but it will take 15min, 15 safe transaction but it will transfer instantly. So i always use this kind of websites to make sure im using the correct amount and not bitting too low. I have more experience with the ETH chain and so far i havent have the need to look for a website like the one i told you for the Binance chain because gas fees are sooo low in the binance chain that is not even worth trying to save some money in those transactions, if the Binance chain gets expensive at some point thats when i will start caring more about fees.

A farm cant really lose liquidity... but if one of the coins is a rug pull and drops to ""zero"", you'll end up with 99.99% of the shit coins, so effectively $0.

E.g. You put in 10 BRY and 10 BNB,
BRY is found to be a scam and tanks to $0.000001

However, the main risk that both coins don't appreciate at the same rate (or completely diverging). This will cause impermanent loss, but as long as both coins appreciate at roughly the same rate, then the IL risk is minimal. This is why PCS rewards its liquidity providers in Cake, both to incentivize providing liquidity and to mitigate the risk of IL. That being said, you are essentially hodling while providing liquidity, so in a sense your friend is correct, however, they are not taking into account the rewards that are being paid in Cake (or whichever other platforms token you are getting paid in).

More users means greater liquidity and greater liquidity further brings more users to the platform. Liquidity is everything in the DeFi world as without it trades result in 'unsuccessful'. 

APR comes with a dark side though. Essentially APR is the same as inflation rate but calling it inflation rate would be poor marketing but the term wouldn't be less accurate. The inflation (APR) rate prevents token price from increasing and in more extreme cases completely crashes the price. People get burnt chasing largest APRs without ever realising they've also been chasing largest inflation rates. 

In the end this means you can't have both. You can't have both a steady token price increase and sustain a high APR rate. You can only have one. You can't have your CAKE and eat it.

12705,[],GodsGardeners,"Sorry I wasn’t clear enough. Yes it is but 1inch essentially ‘pulls’ tokens from BSC but you’re paying ERC gas prices. This is exclusively on the BSC and can run more efficient code. 

Again I understand your concerns but right now marketing is brutal, in order to get heard over the sea of non-tech coins you have to be constantly promoting. Sadly you can’t just rely on tech alone. We’ve had a huge number of new buyers, a steadily increasing market volume and great charts. 

You can call “bullshit” all you want but I’ve offered you further resources and channels to do your own research. I hope when April 2nd comes you’ll consider taking a proper look at the project.  

I’ll set a reminder and if you’re still open to it I’d be happy to help. Sorry you feel so negative, like I said skepticism is good but accusing a project of being a scam without evidence is equally unfair

You cannot trade uni for cake, it is the wrong network. Like trying to install an android app on ios (somebody correct me if i am wrong).

your metamask can hold both the eth network and bsc - it is just in parallel. 

If you want to get to cake, i would look into how much the withdrawl fees are on bittrex. Likely it is easier and cheaper to just sell it on bittrex, withdraw your money and buy on binance some bnb and send that to your metamask, and then exchange for cake. one transfer and you need bnb anyhow for cakes.

&amp;#x200B;

now there might be a bsc chain token you can exchange it into on bittrex, send to your metamask and then exchange on pcs - remember you can exchange any pair. 

also you can send from exchange to exchange - I would test it always, but you dont need to go bittrex - metamask - binance, you can go bittrex binance.",1617708427,t3_ml8t60,t3_ml8t60,1,pancakeswap,0

13325,[],Eagle-1810,"As a fellow Texan I will outline my full path to staking cakes! I use Coinbase, Nexo, and Trust Wallet. 

I buy USDC on coinbase since it's 1:1 for USD and no fee to purchase. I wait for the transfer fee to be reasonable (~$5 for me)  and then send funds to Nexo. Nexo is a great crypto savings platform that also has an exchange. I use that exchange to convert USDC to BNB. I then send that BNB to Trust Wallet. Once on trust Wallet you will need to convert from regular BNB to Smart Chain, once you've done that you can easily access pancake swap on DAPPS tab in trust wallet and covert your BNB to CAKE. Unfortunately at the moment Trust Wallet is only a phone app, no web app just yet. 

Not the easiest but not terribly difficult and if you already have crypto you want to convert you can skip unless coinbase part and send direct to Nexo. For BNB, the withdrawal is cheap so you don't need to worry about becoming platinum on Nexo for that reason. If you decide to use that platform for more than that, it definitely has advantages (5x free withdrawals a month and higher rates - 10% on stablecoins for us 'muricans)",1616994703,t3_mfhero,t3_mfhero,1,pancakeswap,0

Liquidity mining specifically refers to LP positions deposited into DEXes to gain the rewards given by the protocol. Simply put, you providing liquidity to “mine” the rewards from the protocol

2) Farms &amp; Pools are quite interchangeable terms though there are more than just the 50/50 method of LP. 50/50 is using the AMM mechanism whereas other protocols like dodo uses single sided LP and some even have 80/20, etc

Single asset pools generally refer to lending/borrowing, though i wouldnt be quick to say that it only refers to that; because crypto is always growing, and we even have lending pools to be utilised for borrowing in leveraged yield farming now.

3) No impermanent loss. Other risks worth considering are protocol risks (whether the project is sustainable OR is a P&amp;D) &amp; smart contract risks.

By the time it gets its shit together, there's room on the block for more than one farming entity.

For the USD there's the GBP, EURO, CAD, AUD
For Visa, there's Mastercard.
For Chase Manhattan there's etc.

If PCS &amp; Bunny are already well established on the roll out of 2.0 or... Whenever the fuck Cardano is going to do whatever the fuck Cardano does....

I probably won't budge until it sorts its shit out.

Load up while you can lads!!! 🤑🤑 At under $16 a piece, CAKE is an *unbelievable* steal right now.

[We only need $367,574](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/pancakeswap#markets) to push it up the next 2%, but another $1,235,012 before it drops the same.

Let's compare CAKE to UNI:

* 1% of the fees
* 100x the transaction speed
* 10x the farming yields

If CAKE had the same market cap as UNI at it's current supply, a single CAKE token would cost \*$108\* -  almost a 7x move from the current price!!! Also, don't forget [the devs are helping us lowering inflation](https://twitter.com/PancakeSwap/status/1375387141048426496).

The idea of holding accounts in other countries fiat is a very fringe idea in the US.  From a US perspective, entering into cryptoverse, many currancies, valuable in different ways, is preposterous.   Thinking back to Europe before the EURO, people just had to have access to many currancies on pretty quick timelines, no one in Spain was like, ""How could anyone ever possibly need a Franc?""  It was more like, I don't need that tool right now, so can I trade it for one I do need?  America hasn't had that for many generations.  Even travelling, you could spend US fiat in Canada and many other places, no issue. For better or for worse, the US dollar dominance of the last 70 years will not last for the next 70.  

Enter crypto.  I'm in on CAKE because BSC needed a service like UNI for ETH.  Look for projects that solve issues, 

I also like ADA, trying to bring banking services and security to people who live in places where banks don't operate.  That's not all ADA does, but that's what got me into looking at a specific project.

Want to ""own"" Kawhi's triple doink series winning shot?  We can sell that to you, and there's only one, ever.  Collectors get off on that.

LP, compared to staking, requiers monitoring (YieldWatch does an awesome job). You really have to LP a shitcoin to have permanent loss compared to hodling value. Most of the times, APY will largely cover your token loss.

When a swap is made the only thing that remains fixed is the amount of liquidity (number of token 1 \* number of token 2), the total value of your shares is not fixed !

Let me show you with an example :

Imagine a pool start with 1000 T1 and 1000 T2 and the p\[T1\] (price of token1) is equal p\[T2\].

Now imagine P\[T1\]/p\[T2\] is now equal 1.21, as long as the ratio of token1/token2 doesn't reflect that new price there is an opportunity cost to swap some token 2 for token 1.

In fact in this exemple the new equilibrium is 909,09 T1 and  1100 T2 (remember that the number of T1 \* number of T2 remains fixed) therefore 100 T2 have been added to the pool and 90.91 T1 have been extracted.

As you can see 100/90.91 =1.1 therefore the person that seized the opportunity cost made a gain because he/she only paid 100 T2 to get 90.91 T1 where it should have been 110 T2 (90.91\*1.21).

Now if at first p\[T1\]=p\[T2\]=1$ then the initial value of the pool is 2000$.

Imagine that the p\[T1\] remains 1$ and p\[T2\] drops to 1/1.21=\~0.826$ then the example above stands (p\[T1\]/p\[T2\]=1.21) and the total value of the pool after this event is 1818.18$.

If you had kept your initial tokens outside the liquidity pool you would have had 1826.44$ (1000$ of T1 and 826.44$ of T2) the difference 1818.18-1826.44=-8.26$ is the ""impermanent"" loss.

However it is true that you now hold more T2 than at the beginning and if p\[T2\] rise again after you withdrew from the liquidity pool you can end up with more money than if you kept 1000 T1 and 1000 T2.

BUT if you had kept your tokens then trade some of your T1 for some T2 when you identified ""market circumstances"" favorable to T2 you would have had more T2 (110 T2 for 90.91 T1 instead of only 100 T2, see example above).

Moreover, assuming that the total value of your share of the pool remains constant is absolutely false ! (see example above, you started with 2000$ and ended up with 1818$)",1618650298,t3_ms3gke,t1_gus49xr,1,pancakeswap,0

14651,[],opteryx907,"I am two days new to this, so take it for what it’s worth. I was wondering this too, so I took two equal portions of BNB, and did the following:

1. On pancake swap, I split one pile of BNB into 50% BNB and 50% CAKE, and added to the liquidity pool, and then took the resultant FLIP tokens and put them on the farm, which said it should earn around 140% APY. 

2. I took the other pile of BNB and swapped it for CAKE, then took the CAKE to pancake bunny and staked it directly, for around 825% auto-compounding. 

After 24 hours I earned about 30% more cake from the farming. However, over time, the auto compounding of the CAKE (plus the BUNNY that I’m also supposedly getting), should accelerate my earnings from direct staking. Yes, you can manually compound your farm earnings, and stake your CAKE in SYRUP on pancake swap, but that requires periodic management, and a level of understanding that I just don’t have yet. 

So the answer probably depends on how much time you plan to leave your funds invested and how involved you want to be. If the answer to the first question is a day or two, you might come ahead by farming, but if you are talking weeks or months or years, the clear answer is directly staking CAKE on something like Pancake Bunny or Beefy.

Reposting this reply here because your other thread is filled with garbage posts.



Did you buy on a desktop or a mobile?  Over the last few days people on mobile have been reporting very high gas fees.  For some reason sometimes it's  charging eth gas fees instead of bsc gas fees --  you need to manually adjust the gas fees to make sure it's  the bsc gas rate (10 gwie or so).

Also you can go on www.bscscan.com  and put in your wallet address to look at your purchase transaction.   That will show how much you spent, how much you got, and how much you paid in gas.


As a side note --  in terms of buying, slippage refers to the guaranteed minimum amount of coins that you are going to receive.  Safemoon has 11% slippage because it covers the 10% tax + 1% price fluxuations.    On $40k, you should have gotten close to $35.6k worth of Safemoon.

That doesn't  explain the whole amount that your missing, but it's  a start.   As mentioned above  bscscan.com  will show you the exact transaction.",1617629736,t3_mkk548,t3_mkk548,1,pancakeswap,0

14979,[],42337d,"Liquidity Pool's APY are only accurate if the two assets stay correlated. If there is volatility you incur IL. People don't realize that yield for non correlated assets that can have high variance in price, your profit is only what's left after subracting IL, so you have to hope your yield outpaces your losses. Add to the fact that the yield farm's tokens bought probably lost a considerable amount in value, so you have to make that up as well. LPs with correlated assets provide more accurate APY, but usually don't provide the ludicrous high yield % range that you see with these shitcoin LPs. There's a reason why.

Shitcoin ponzis lure people with trillion/billion/million APYs because the yield is worthless uncapped shitcoin they are printing out of thin air. They will pair it with a valuable coin like BNB or BUSD. The unsuspecting victim thinks they will get rich the more they put in, so they buy a grip of their shitcoin. This drives up the price and others fomo in. All the while the scammers running the site are dumping their large bags. The victims think even though there's ""a dip"" their yield makes up for it. They also feel locked in to at least get their 5% deposit back. What they don't realize is that their LP is getting sucked dry of the valuable BNB or BUSD and replaced with more shitcoin. In the end their LP and all the yield they produced are worthless. Pancake is legit because they are backed by Binance and became the most liquid DEX on BSC. They eventually came up with use cases for their like the lottery which makes up a significant portion of the transactions. Stop and think what real world use would anyone have for Viking coin, Goose Egg coin, Kebab coin, or the hundreds of other garbage swamp tokens of the crypto world. They are obvious scams. Some are one week hit it and quit it rug pulls, some are protracted slow rugs where the dumps happen slowly and the scam goes as long as it sustainably can, some are ""failed project"" rugs. All of these have things in common... some gimmick, investors lose their crypto, and the people running the site make off with the loot.

Even if it's not a shitcoin ponzi (pretty much all the cartoon pancakeswap clones), legit coins with good intentions can also suffer from IL. IL is worse than people realize even if it doesn't go to zero. Let's say you're participating in a Coin X and BNB LP. Coin X loses half its value. Your LP will gain more Coin X and lose BNB. Now if BNB goes up in value, you have much less of it so you don't benefit from the value appreciation. You may think well as long as Coin X goes up in value, I'm good, but it's not that simple. Very unlikely, but if Coin X does pump up and BNB performs poorly, your LP loses Coin X and replaced by more BNB. That's why IL is very difficult to recover from. Your yield has to be consistently higher than your IL.

Stay away from all of these Pancake clones with a different cartoon giving unreal APY. This APY (while is accurate for that snapshot in time) is actually not accurate because it CANNOT sustain itself over time. You might as well look at it as a negative APY because over an actual year you will definitely lose money. Even if you time it right, t's very unlikely that you will profit because people tend to get greedy and don't bail before they start treading in the red. Also consider that these scams can blindside you from any direction. Some raise funds for an IFO and then never even launch and disappear. Some keep it going as long as possible before abruptly rugpulling. You never know when the bottom falls and it comes when you least expect it.

Another untruth that these scams use is that they were audited, and that they can't rugpull because they pulled out the ""rugpull code"". This is simply a nice narrative. In no way does it keep them honest. Example: [https://taco.finance/](https://taco.finance/) They were audited by Hacken, have 48hr timelock, and removed the rugpull vulnerability from pancake's copied code. As far as I am told, they were active in their Telegram, telling people of all the future plans they had and keeping people going with promises of coin burns. All the while they dumped their bags to oblivion and now it's nearing the end. These same people also ran the same scam on ETH defi last year with [https://www.tacoswap.io/](https://www.tacoswap.io/) and they milked the shit out of investors.

dex = decentralized like pancakeswap, all is based on the blockchain.

separate them:

if you buy bnb on a dex for 200 and leave it there and then buy for 600 on pcs to stake in something (just a created example) and then after a month sell that bnb again for 800 usually your irs will use a fifo principle and claim you sold your first in first out bnb = you made 600 profit.

if you check 'separate by depots', you bought and hold for 200 by dex and you bought and sold on pcs for 600/800 = only 200 profit. 

you still will need to check them, they are not perfect but sometimes that is because they only can use what the other side gives them. I was missing a small position from binance and then it turns out in the export binance says ""unknown status"" while showing the asset fully in my portfolio. 

So I do recommend setting up a small process where you also track your buy and sells in excel on a very high level for your own mini analysis, and crosscheck them with the tax tool for full tax reporting. in cointracking that could look like ""note what you traded, wait for the imports to happen, export the result to excel from the tool""

In the case of CAKE, it also has some actual utility that would induce buying pressure. For example, it can be used to buy lottery, it can be used for staking to earn other project's token, most powerful utility imo it is needed to participate in IFO, the CAKE used in IFO will be 100% burnt. 

That being said, people could also be simply using the CAKE they earned from farming, in which case although it does increase sparsity of CAKE it doesn't create buying pressure on CAKE.  


So I think it is somewhat possible to make a guesstimate on the value of CAKE but I haven't attempt doing it yet.

Firstly, you do understand the rate on pancakeswap doesn't follow exactly to binance right? They are different exchanges and each have their own rates. Of course, the ratios can't stay different for a long time as people will benefit from arbitrage.

Anyway, on binance, 9.52am, there was a pretty cake sell-off (relative to 1 minute chart) and crashed CAKE/BNB ratio down to 0.04 by 9.57am (your transaction time)

Using 0.04, you should have gotten 2.4864BNB, your transaction ratio was 0.03877.

During a ""huge"" sell-off, you are bound to find slight ratio differences between exchanges.

Can people please do their research and understand how pancakeswap works before complaining.

* 2 numbers, 1/1 odds, 38 tickets  ≈ $917 (currently) - If you only play the largest daily pool, you would be splitting $275,000 in cake. The most recent large pool had 2,179 winners, so $126 of cake.
* 3 numbers, 1/1 odds, 738 tickets  ≈ $17,822 (currently) - Largest recent pool, 126 people had 3 correct numbers and split 22,773 cake or $549,968, netting them each $4,365 in cake.
* 4 numbers, 1/1 odds, 38,416 tickets ≈ $927,746 (currently) - Largest recent pool had 1 winner of 56,932 cake or $1,374,907 though often nobody wins. If you won it alone, this is actually the best play statistically, but if you had to split it with even one person you then just lost about $450,000.  If you played it a few times with 38,416 tickets you'd likely have a net profit.

Keep in mind, as you go up in tickets you'd also likely be winning many of the 2 number and 3 number spots, but you would be splitting those with other winners AND your own other tickets.

Take a look at the basics. Presentation, handling of publicity.  The way the devs act on camera, education, implementation. From everything ive seen these guys are the most unprofessional crap ive seen so far.

Go watch videos or presentations from actual companies doing actual infrastructure work on blockchains. They are established llc's. The devs are educated, carry themselves professionally and have an agenda to improve blockchain tech or programs on the platforms such as games or programs for services. Like VET which is on one of chinas largest blockchains. They are a commodities tracking company with contracts with large conpanies like tesla and coca cola. 

Safemoon is a buncha douchebags jerking off. I watched an ama and not only did they not answer one serious question about the project, the web dev did a beer blast with his cat tree in the background spilling beer on his floor and another one is vaping the whole time. None of them are dressed professionally or groomed and presentable. Its either a bini and and shorts and a ninja turtles shirt.  Talkin bout lambo now (with your money).

If u had an account at a wells fargo and the employees were doing beer blasts and vaping and dressed unprofessionally, would you think twice about handing them hundreds of dollars? Cause thats exactly what yer doing. Giving a bunch of vaping, beer blasting, unkempt,  uneducated douchebags your money to f with.

 They can do ama's 3 days a week until the very day they actually decide to exit scam and dissapear. Cause naturally they will have millions to dissappear with.

15615,[],JohnnyJordaan,"The thing is that the tokens are open source code files that are present in the blockchain. See here for Cake for example: https://bscscan.com/address/0x0e09fabb73bd3ade0a17ecc321fd13a19e81ce82#code . Unless there is a part in that code that allows some kind of manipulation, there is no possibility to 'take down the token' by a malicious dev or something like that. In practice, what does happen is that the contract contains a bug that allows misuse, which is why some tokens have fallen out of use in the past. 

What could happen is that Binance somehow has the option to manipulate the entire BSC, or that it itself risks security issues (like gaining 51% control). That's the problem of using a chain put forward by a closed source party with a commercial interest vs ERC20 or Cardano or other open source project smart chains.

Altough btw to me the highest risk here is a rug pull on the swap websites, as then your liquidity is hurt or even evaporates. That's not the same as taking down the token, it's more like closing the bank(s). But then it's still possible for another party to launch a swap website again (as the blockchain is publicly accessible and thus so are its contracts). 

&gt; That is my main concern with the way these AMM tokens are created ; it's the lack of security. It's one thing to look at a pool like PSC with it's TVL and think that the project is too big to fail, but CAKE can be deleted on a whim just like all of the other tokens within DeFi. It won't, but it could.

15880,[],Opitmus_Prime,"APR is a fixed % on daily basis 

APY is compounded % if compounded once per day

so with 158% APR = 158/365 = 0.43% per day

when compounded every day

first day you have $1 next day it becomes $1 + (1\*0.0043) = 1.0043 

Then next day you will have $1.0043 + (1.0043\*0.0043) = 1 + 0.0043\*2 + 0.0043\*0.0043

  
So basically by compounding you have 0.0043\*0.0043 in addition to the usual APR 0.0043\*2  


The general formula is (1 + x%) \^ y   
where x = % APR per time (like 0.43% per day)  
and y is the compounding times   


Therefore when you compound   
(1 + 0.0043%)  \^ 365 = 4.78 (thats total at the end )  
profits will be 4.78-1 = 3.78 = 378% that is the APY  


That means generally you can get 0.43% APR   
but if you let the investment run for whole 365 days then you will have ""effective"" APR (APY) will be 378/365 = 1% per day   


These are deceivingly higher for longer durations of compounding. So make sure you calculate like above

I wish i would have seen this when i first started, really appreciate you writing this out for others who may make the same mistake as me.

Let me outline what happened and how i'm now hopelessly stuck, maybe you guys have some suggestions?

&amp;#x200B;

Basically;

My younger brother had been wanting to invest in crypto for a while, he follows it semi-casually and he had a few ideas of where to invest. We started together 3 days ago. We didn't much experience at all.

We researched the market and eventually settled on Pancakeswap, i really like the interface and the growth + the reviews online seemed really promising, 

We bought 1 cake using the Binance app.

After that, we learned about these things called Liquidation Pools that were being hosted on the pancakeswap website. We got the general gist of what it meant and decided to transfer our whole cake to Metamask.

From metamask we tried to send it to the liquidation pool on the website, but as you've explained, you need a BNB balance to do so. We didn't have much cash left ( it was more than enough for the cost of the transaction) But u need to deposit a minimum of like 0.05 BNB or something, which costs more than what we had.

(I later realized 1 cake is the signup fee, thats before u can even put crypto in the pools, so it wouldnt have worked anyways)

Knowing this, we tried returning the Cake back to our Binance wallet... Unfortunately thats when we learned about gas lmao. It didn't take gas to put it INTO metamask, but apparently it takes gas to take it OUT.

And the same deal with BNB... you only need a small amount of gas, but the added fees and/or minimum deposit, blow the price up massively.

Essentially now, our cake is stuck in Metamask, i'm not interested in LPs or farming anymore, i'd just like to get the cake back into the binance wallet, but it seems like the cost alone of getting it out is the cost of the cake itself. So it's very counter productive.

I'd appreciate any suggestions or advice,

but yeah, let this be a cautionary tale lol, know what you're doing before you mess with cryptos.",1618759842,t3_mtdykg,t3_mtdykg,1,pancakeswap,0

MTO is an ERC-20 token that aims to bring traditional merchant services protections to e-commerce and POS sales by utilizing Automatic Dispute Management (ADM). Its also backward compatible with financial protocols like ISO8583, which would enable crypto payments in standard terminal messages, using the existing terminal, and card scheme infrastructures for crypto payments. Awesome. This is exactly what we need to fuel mass adoption of crypto as a means to pay for things, because right now, I believe people feel that using crypto as payment is still impractical. 

Naturally, there's an elevated risk in buying ICOs but this one seemed more promising than others. I also like that there's only 100m coins.

Further, if you want to buy Mechant Token, you can follow these steps. First set up your Mechant token wallet/account. 

https://merchanttoken.org?ref=0M2CGU2FY

Then, go to Coinbase and load up on the USD Coin you wanna spend on Merchant Token. Then on your merchant token dashboard, select the buy with coinbase option. You'll enter your email, (be sure to use the same email that you used to set up your merchant token wallet/account, this is important), then select the token you want to purchase MTO with (i.e. USD Coin). Generate the receiving address to send the USD coin to and copy it to your clipboard. Then go back to coinbase and send the USD coin you bought to the USD coin address you generated in your merchant coin dashboard. Boom. You're all set. Your MTO will show up in your MTO wallet within a few minutes.

Always do your own research. Here's a good overview of the coin for the pertinent details and team info.

I actually use non-US Binance so I can’t speak for the way people access pancakeswap over there, but abroad at least I had to first go through trustwallet and then find Pcs on their dapp list. 

So I’m guessing a government could go after Binance in a sense but then Binance could just say “talk to the trustwallet people” right?

In the end, Defi is supposed to be about taking the power out of a single controlling entity, which in this sense Binance says “Buidl” or whatever and people just build on it. There have been some rumors that PCS was started by some ex-Binance employees, but that certainly doesn’t make PCS a part of Binance or make them liable for what PCS does.

A case in court against Binance US could hurt their reputation slightly and cause some panic selling but Binance is much bigger than the US and people like me would still be able to access pancakes and all the other stuffs :-) 

The last bit here is where someone takes this case to an AG or any government entity and tries to explain what happened. I can’t even get my young friends to understand what the hell “pancakes” and “bunnies” are, much less get them to take any of this seriously.

I have actually *presumed* that beefy is adding BIFI rewards... because that's what  autofarm does with AUTO; beefy shows higher APY for a few pairs so it makes sense they are adding something on top. There is another guy above who is saying that BIFI is only awarded for some pairs, so you'll have to find out yourself.

There is a fantastic [data aggregation tool](https://www.yieldwatch.net/) which will do all that for you if you enter your wallet address. It will show you your yields (increases in LP tokens which you receive when you 'cash out') and pending/harvested rewards which would be the BIFI tokens (if they are being awarded). It also tells you the result of any impermanent loss! Pretty cool. The site works for multiple DEXs, but not all of them yet.

There is a pro version too which has more statistics, but you need to hold some WATCH tokens to get the pro version. Whether or not you have the Pro version seems to depend on the value of your farms compared to your WATCH holdings. For example, if you have $10k USD in your farms you need 60 WATCH tokens in your wallet for the pro statistics, but if you have $20K USD you need 120 WATCH.
