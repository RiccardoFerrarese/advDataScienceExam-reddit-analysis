"302",322,2021-01-11,"xChrisMas","yeah but calculation profits when a coin basically at its ath is counterproductive. The ATH wont stay forever and mining a significant amount of coins takes time. Mining is bound to a lot of upfront cost, a ROI depenting on coin value and difficulty.

If it's your hobby and you have fun doing this and setting up your rig, yeah go for it but dont expect ROI or profit soon.

Otherwise youre better off just buying the coin directly for the money you would have otherwise invested in mining gear.For example back in 2017 I bought mining gear worth around 3500‚Ç¨, mined some coins, sold them directly to meet my ROI faster. End of story was that i barley made 500‚Ç¨ profit after selling off my eth and mining equipment right before the crash. I could have bought \~14 Eth for that money at the time i bought the mining equipment. Likewise could have gotten 10-14K by selling the coins near ATH.

Ive learned from my mistake and bought 12Eth last year in Feb for around 1200‚Ç¨, which I've now sold off for around a 1000‚Ç¨ each."

"305",325,2021-01-11,"on_roft","Yes, lots and lots of DEXes. Don't know how Bisq works, but you can buy and sell ETH and lots of Ethereum tokens on places like Uniswap, 1inch, SushiSwap, etc. If you want to convert between stablecoins use Curve.fi. Beware that transaction fees (gas) can be pretty high, and that there are steps to a swap (approving tokens, possibly manually adding tokens to your wallet so that you can see your balance). Right now gas costs are really high (count on paying 20-80 USD for a swap), so it's not a good idea to use DEXes for small amounts. If you want to swap fairly large amounts, I'd recommend using Uniswap and reading a little bit of Quick Start guides or similar to avoid most common mistakes. https://uniswap.org

There are lots of good wallets for ETH. For day-to-day stuff I recommend Metamask. It also supports hardware wallets. You can use it with or without a hardware wallet. 

You need a ""wallet"" application in your computer, and one on the hardware wallet. The one on the computer constructs transactions for you. It then sends it to your HWW. You need to have the Ethereum app installed and open on your HWW. Then the wallet will recognize the transaction and ask you if you want to sign it. Make sure you check that things look correct on the HWW before signing: correct address, amount, etc.

I recommend joining the Uniswap Discord for quick questions.

It's a deep rabbit hole from there if you want to go crazy."

We are two friends who quit our day jobs last year to fulfill an old dream to start our own company.

A year and many long nights later, we have built a Fantasy Football platform built on Loom Network with a bridge to Ethereum. Our Player Cards are non-fungible tokens and we have official partnerships with football clubs (currently around 40, with 60 top clubs to be announced by the end of the year) and the support of gaming giant Ubisoft.

Currently, we are in Beta testing and we are looking for help to test our platform. That's where you fellow redditors come in. We've made ETH as our in-game currency but we need help and all your feedback to make this game and ETH as an accepted means of payment. 

Here is a link to our website: [https://sorare.com/?referrer=reddit](https://sorare.com/?referrer=reddit)

If you have any questions or comments you can contact us directly by email: [hello@sorare.com](mailto:hello@sorare.com) or just comment below.

With either one, the more you invest, the more your rewards. Those giant mining rigs don't come cheap.

But with PoW, there are economies of scale, geographic advantages for people who can get cheap electricity, and advantages to people with special relationship with ASIC makers, who can get the newest chips before everyone else. That's why a handful of miners in China dominate Bitcoin.

PoS has none of that. Buy some coins, stake them, and you're on a level playing field with everyone else. Hardware requirements are minimal, and generic.

Now with *delegated* PoS, on chains like EOS, it's different, you only have a handful of giant stakers by design, because that's all the protocol can handle. But Ethereum's PoS allows a very large number of stakers."
"451",478,2020-10-18,"TNoD","Is that ""a good thing"" though? Coin issuance in a fair way (e.g. pow) helps the coin be more distributed and fair. If you keep issuance up and switch to PoS, you have a more unfair system where the rich get even richer. If you switch to PoS and drop issuance, the existing holders get richer and the barrier of entry is higher.

There is no doubt in my mind that btc will lose its #1 place eventually, but I hope BCH takes its place."

Eth 2.0 has been in development since 2015 but had failed to gain traction due to the highly technical expertise required to pursue it, until now. First of all, upgrading itself means improvement of technology and optimization of the original system, which is such a benefit in concept; secondly, the ETH2.0 version is the replacement of the original one, and with the POS mechanism introduced, it will gradually replace The old POW which indicates that there will be a large number of ETH holders who will pledge their holdings to obtain the identity of the verifier in order to obtain the opportunities of block rewards. Then the ETH in circulation will reduce and may cause a sharp rise in demand, which will lead to deflation, and the price of the currency will naturally be bullish. In the end, ETH will usher in two block forks. On the occasion, the amount of distribution will be reduced by ten times following with a reduction of supply, and eventually, bring the increase of the upgrade release demand. Those two combinations will lead to the arrival of a super bull market for ETH.

According to official Bitoffer statistics, under the stimulated by variable bull market conditions, ETH has climbed as high as 125% in the past three months since the Ethereum ETF has risen about 200% over the same period. In the past three months, the 24-hour trading volume of ETH has achieved around 7 billion US dollars and daily turnover of ETF reached $1billion. It shows the year-over-year growth compared with the same period last year with a daily upward trend. Being the world‚Äôs largest trading platform, Bitoffer owns more than 80% Ethereum ETF share accounted within the market. Therefore, in the upsurge of Ethereum ETF fund transactions gradually catching up with the ETH itself

"543",570,2020-05-15,"dkp1990","Ok here's an example.

I hold MCO and the current price is $5 per MCO

I want to buy bitcoin because I believe the price will reach $10000 and the current price is $8000, but I also believe that the price of MCO will go up.

With the loan requiring 75% loan to value.

I deposit 2,134 MCO wich equals roughly $10,666 and I receive 1 bitcoin.

The MCO is still mines so any increase I still capitalize on any increase.

The loan is at 7% annual so that's equal to $46.67 for a 30 day loan. And then there is a loan match fee equal to 1% of the loan amount, in this case it will be  $80 because the loan was for 1 bitcoin at $8000.

That leaves total cost at $126.67

Bitcoin rises to $10,000 
Profit = 10,000-( borrowed amount 8000+ total cost 126.67)= $1873.33 

PLUS 
During loan MCO rises to $5.50 √ó 2134 = Total value is now  $11,737 vs $10,666 when opened the loan.

Result in total account gain of $1873.33 from bitcoin + equity increase of $1071 from MCO price increase
= $2944.33"
